      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Rep. Ro Khanna,</u> D-Calif., is calling on the Trump administration to investigate the case that imprisoned former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on corruption charges, following <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/secret-brazil-archive/">The Intercept&#8217;s exposé</a> that showed Judge Sérgio Moro plotted with prosecutors to convict Lula and prevent the Workers’ Party from returning to power.</p>\n<p>“This reporting confirms what we knew all along — that Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail,” Khanna told The Intercept in an emailed statement. “While [it&#8217;s] not for America to make a factual judgement on Lula’s innocence, this reporting shows Moro was not impartial and coordinated with the prosecutors. This violates all judicial norms and ethics. I hope the Trump administration supports a full investigation into this matter given Lula is still in jail and Moro is Bolsonaro’s justice minister.”</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump has embraced Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s right-wing president who, like Trump, has a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/28/jair-bolsonaro-elected-president-brazil/">history</a> of making bigoted, homophobic, and misogynistic statements and even paid a visit to the White House in March.</p>\n<p>“They say he’s the Donald Trump of South America,” Trump<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election-results-trump-2018-10"> said </a>during a speech this past January. &#8220;Do you believe that? And he’s happy with that. If he wasn’t, I wouldn’t like the country so much. But I like him.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil published excerpts from a massive trove of secret documents, including<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/"> private admissions of doubt from prosecutors </a>about whether there was sufficient evidence to prove Lula’s guilt. The sweeping corruption probe, known as Operation Car Wash, stretches back five years and has resulted in hundreds of people being charged with hundreds of crimes.</p>\n<p>Lula, who was elected president in 2002 and 2006, was indicted under the probe and found guilty in 2017 of corruption and money laundering, charges that were connected to accepting bribes from construction firms. He was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Lula’s imprisonment forced him out of the 2018 presidential race, which he was widely expected to win; this paved the way for Bolsonaro, who then appointed Moro as justice minister. According to the archive, the prosecution also worked on strategies to prevent a prison interview with Lula during the election out of fear it could help the Workers’ Party.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>“That the same judge who found Lula guilty was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-sergio-moro-brazil-justice-ministry-anti-corruption">rewarded by Lula’s victorious opponent</a> made even longtime supporters of the Car Wash corruption probe uncomfortable, due to the obvious perception (real or not) of a quid pro quo, and by the transformation of Moro, who long insisted he was apolitical, into a political official working for the most far-right president ever elected in the history of Brazil’s democracy,” our report<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/"> said</a>. “Those concerns heightened when Bolsonaro <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2019/05/bolsonaro-says-he-will-nominate-sergio-moro-to-the-supreme-court.shtml">recently admitted</a> that he had also promised to appoint Moro to a lifelong seat on the Supreme Court as soon as there was a vacancy.”</p>\n<p>In light of The Intercept’s reporting, Moro <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/leaked-carwash-messages-spark-calls-for-moro-to-resign-in-brazil">is facing growing calls</a> to step down from public office, including from the Brazilian Bar Association, which called for his suspension and for an investigation to be conducted.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/11/brazil-lula-ro-khanna-operation-car-wash/">Rep.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>We Build the Wall,</u> the crowdfunded, ultra-right group that put up a multimillion-dollar border wall just west of El Paso in southern New Mexico, has said that it only builds on private land. But earlier this month, the group extended its wall onto government land — without asking first for government permission.</p>\n<p>The extension is a wall with a locking gate that has closed a federal road next to the Rio Grande, at the intersection of Mexico, Texas, and New Mexico. Beyond the gate is a storied monument celebrating binational cooperation known as Monument One. For decades, it has been visited by locals who’ve enjoyed the area as a park. A We Build the Wall supporter last week said that the only people allowed to unlock the gate would be employees of the Border Patrol, the owner of the adjacent American Eagle Brick Company, and the International Boundary and Water Commission.</p>\n<p>We Build the Wall adviser Steve Bannon bragged last month that the private border wall, which now snakes for almost a half-mile up a mountain, had for months been planned in secret, so as not to give protesters or civil rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union time to mount challenges. Heavy equipment started rumbling onto the property in late May, as land co-owner Jeff Allen forbade the media and the curious from getting near enough to see what was going on.</p>\n<p>Allen did permit a group of armed vigilantes known as the United Constitutional Patriots to freely roam his property, where they captured and harangued immigrants, and livestreamed <a href="https://theappeal.org/border-patrol-in-new-mexico-stood-by-as-right-wing-militia-terrorized-migrants/">their sadistic activities</a> on Facebook.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="immigrants" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>We Build the Wall’s secrecy allowed it to erect the wall without performing environmental impact studies or receiving building permits. The small, impoverished, and mostly Latinx city of Sunland Park, New Mexico, after initially resisting the illegal wall-building, eventually <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/31/private-border-wall/">gave in</a> after a barrage of phone calls, death threats, and harassment.</p>\n<p>IBWC has seemed open to the  right-wing lobbying group’s taking over of federal land and since June 2 has entertained giving We Build the Wall a permit. After nine days of waffling, the federal agency took action Monday to keep the gate open. In response, We Build the Wall has begun a bullying campaign against IBWC.</p>\n<h3>A Sensitive, Historic Site</h3>\n<p>On May 31, the new wall was feted on site by right-wing supporters, including anti-immigration politicians Kris Kobach and Tom Tancredo. The next day, Jim Benvie — formerly a leader of the United Constitutional Patriots vigilante group and now active in a spinoff called the Guardian Patriots — livestreamed migrants walking past the wall. They were headed into New Mexico to surrender to Border Patrol agents and request asylum. “A group of illegals just pushed across our construction site!” tweeted Brian Kolfage, founder of We Build the Wall. Benvie told his Facebook audience that We Build the Wall would soon be blocking the road that the migrants had used — the IBWC road.</p>\n<p>On June 2, according to IBWC public affairs spokesperson Lori Kuczmanski, employees working near the Rio Grande saw the extension being prepared. That afternoon, IBWC received an emailed request for a permit to block the road. The permit application was incomplete, and IBWC Commissioner Jayne Harkins told the construction company that “the gate needs to stay open.”</p>\n<p>But building began immediately. Kuczmanski said the agency asked We Build the Wall to halt construction, but the next day the construction on the gate was completed, locking the IBWC off its own land. Mike Furey, a construction foreman, told the media that Harkins had approved it. For several days thereafter, the IBWC asked We Build the Wall to keep the gate open, but it remained closed.</p>\n<p>Historically, the IBWC has promoted binational friendship and cooperation. Founded in 1889, the agency works with its Mexican counterpart, the Comisión Internacional de Límites y Aguas, to manage irrigation and drinking water for both countries. The U.S. and Mexican commissioners meet regularly to discuss their shared stakes in the Rio Grande and Colorado and Tijuana rivers.</p>\n<p>IBWC’s management of rivers entails stewardship of the larger environment. But the potential environmental ramifications of the new wall remain unclear. With We Build the Wall failing to complete an environmental assessment, scientists and policymakers can only estimate the potential damage to the area from mudslides, erosion, and air and water pollution caused by the displacement of contaminated soil.</p>\n<p>Furey, the foreman, was quick to point out how close the new wall is to the Rio Grande. What he ignored are the risks associated with a massive build directly uphill from the American Dam, which diverts drinking and irrigation water to Mexico and West Texas farmland. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Rio Grande is highly endangered. It suffers from over-extraction of water, pollution, and high usage. To further complicate things, the remains of the ASARCO smelter, an EPA-declared Superfund site, sit a stone’s throw from the new wall.</p>\n<p>ASARCO processed lead, zinc, silver, and copper from 1887 through 1999 in El Paso. Sulfur dioxide and heavy metals billowed out of the company’s giant smokestacks, with lead and arsenic contaminating soil and groundwater throughout the area. At one point, the Centers for Disease Control found that more than half of the children living within a mile of the smelter had blood lead levels dangerously higher than the acceptable limit. The American Eagle Brick Company, site of the wall, sits less than a third of a mile from ASARCO’s former plant.</p>\n<p>In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency named the American Dam site a spot of high contamination. A 2015 study demonstrated that the force of demolishing the ASARCO smokestacks enlarged the contaminated area, and found higher levels of lead in 2015 than had been recorded in 1993 and 2001. These findings suggest that bulldozing contaminated dirt releases toxins into the air and water.</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to We Build the Wall’s construction work, tons of dirt from the contamination zone have been bulldozed. Environmental experts agree that the dirt will make its way into the Rio Grande, although it is too early to fully assess hazardous effects. Without an environmental impact assessment, one El Paso-based hydrologist told The Intercept, the long-term repercussions are &#8220;anyone&#8217;s guess.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-254397" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/20190606-_DSC5809-1560188877.jpg" alt="20190606-_DSC5809-1560188877" /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">Monument One, which marks the boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, on June 6, 2019.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Jordyn Rozensky/Frontera Studio</p></div>\n<h3>Decades of Community History</h3>\n<p>The natural environment is not the only aspect of the border region that is endangered by the private wall. Border society is also an ecology. Binational human culture, people’s ease with living in and loving two countries, is seriously endangered by the increasing depredations of border militarization.</p>\n<p>Monument One, also known as International Boundary Marker No. 1, was established more than 160 years ago, before the Civil War. It defined the first surveyor’s point on the land border from New Mexico to California.</p>\n<p>Local historians and policymakers began lobbying for a binational park on the marker site as early as 1938, and their efforts paid off in December 1972, when a landscaped park was dedicated much to the delight of Mexican and American citizens. Two bronze plaques, one in English and one in Spanish, were placed among flowers and trees planted by community garden groups. Dignitaries from Juarez, El Paso, and Sunland Park spoke of the importance of unity over division, marveling at the shared land and pointing toward a future of continued solidarity and partnership.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the monument has been known as a quiet piece of history. It’s famous as a unique spot to snap a photo of oneself in two countries while also enjoying the stark beauty of the high desert mountains. In the summer, Mexican families travel there after spending the afternoon splashing and fishing in the Rio Grande. On the U.S. side, hikers and naturalists have used the federal levee road to watch birds, fish, and visit Monument One.</p>\n<p>The road partly belongs to the IBWC, but other sections are owned by George Cudahy and Jeff Allen, who are now the hosts for We Build the Wall’s construction. At least since 2017, the two have been intermittently chasing visitors off the road. On June 7, a local ACLU lawyer tried to visit the monument, but was <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLUNM/status/1137132269364162560">turned away by Allen</a> amid a stream of epithets.</p>\n<p>The IBWC has been slow to challenge this private blockade. When it finally took action this week, We Build the Wall and its militia allies launched a vicious attack on the agency, using tactics similar to those they lobbed against Sunland Park.</p>\n<p>On Monday, IBWC, accompanied by sheriff deputies, opened the gate and, according to Kuczmanski, told We Build the Wall that any tampering with the gate would be “considered trespassing and further action will be taken.” We Build the Wall reacted with outrage. The group called for the firing of Commissioner Harkins and mobilized supporters. Kolfage fulminated on his Twitter feed that the opening of the gate was due to the IBWC’s being “half owned by Mexico,” and Benvie live-streamed on Facebook that if the IBWC and the ACLU “want a war, they’ll get war.”</p>\n<p>But the agency has called only for the gate to remain open – it has taken no action to tear it down. Nor has the IBWC shown regard for the surrounding community’s history.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people keep asking me and calling me,” Kuczmanski, the agency’s public affairs officer, told The Intercept. She said they are insisting that Monument One is a park. “It’s not a park,” she said.</p>\n<p>Since the wall was erected, tourists have continued to visit Monument One on the Mexico side, said Mexican police who patrol the area. But if they step too close to the wall, they are intimidated by people just over the line on the U.S. side. There have been incidents, according to Mexican authorities, of verbal harassment shouted through the slots of the bollards by construction workers and others.</p>\n<p>Days after the wall went up, congressional Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso spoke to the El Paso Times and condemned the wall’s hosts for “furthering this xenophobic narrative.” She called the wall “necessary fuel” for Trump’s further political ambitions. El Paso City Rep. Peter Svarzbein evoked the wounding of the binational psyche, saying that he was concerned that public access to Monument One would be interrupted. He called the monument a “federal park that highlights the best of the values, culture, and history of our community here on the border.”</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, We Build the Wall promotes its multimillion-dollar structure as a model alternative to Trump’s stymied, public-works wall project. That rhetoric has seduced Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, a border native who staunchly opposes publicly funded walls. CNN recently asked him about the wall and the people who erected it. “What you do on your private property, including building a wall, is your business,” O’Rourke <a href="https://www.facebook.com/debbie.nathan.31/videos/vb.705307034/10156021036432035/?type=2&amp;theater&amp;notif_t=video_processed&amp;notif_id=1560174090862">said</a>. “Good for them.”</p>\n<p>Border residents who do know the area and hold it dear have tried to explain why few organizations so far have protested the new wall or the blocking of Monument One. Some cite safety concerns, knowing of We Build the Wall’s connection to an armed militia. Only the ACLU of New Mexico has taken action, asking the public to call and write to the IBWC. “You have a private group that is allowed to appropriate federal land to carry out a political purpose,” said director Peter Simonson. He said the ACLU is still analyzing the situation to determine its next steps. Meanwhile, the public&#8217;s access to Monument One remains fraught.</p>\n<p>A public middle school teacher, Tom Wilson, said he has hiked and bicycled the area with his family for over 30 years and is now furious and grief-stricken at the prospect of being banished from Monument One.</p>\n<p>“For a long time now,” Wilson said, “Trump’s sons of bitches have declared this area ground zero in the war on immigrants. It’s exhausting. It never stops, and one thing follows another so fast. There’s a weariness here now. The border is our heritage, but people are tired. They shrug their shoulders and say, What’s next?”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/11/private-border-wall-federal-land/">Private Border Wall Expands Onto Federal Land, Blocking Access to Historic Site</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>A member of</u> Project Veritas gave testimony in a federal court case indicating that the right-wing group, known for its undercover videos, violates Facebook policies designed to counter systematic deception by Russian troll farms and other groups. The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.178412/gov.uscourts.mad.178412.126.1.pdf">deposition</a> raises questions over whether Facebook will deter American operatives who use the platform to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/29/project-veritas-how-fake-news-prize-went-to-rightwing-group-beloved-by-trump">strategically deceive and damage political opponents</a> as vigorously as it has Iranian and Russian propagandists. But is the company capable of doing so without just creating more problems?</p>\n<p>Close observers of Veritas and Facebook, including one at a research lab that works with the social network, said the testimony shows the group is clearly violating policies against what Facebook refers to as “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” The company formally defined such behavior in a <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/">December 2018 video</a> featuring its cybersecurity policy chief Nathaniel Gleicher, who said it “is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they’re doing.” The designation, Gleicher added, is applied by Facebook to a group not “because of the content they’re sharing” but rather only “because of their deceptive behavior.” That is, using Facebook to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/womans-effort-to-infiltrate-the-washington-post-dates-back-months/2017/11/29/ce95e01a-d51e-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.bc12e8cee3b1">dupe people</a> is all it takes to fit the company’s institutional definition of coordinated inauthentic behavior.</p>\n<p>In practice, “coordinated inauthentic behavior” has become a sort of catchall label for untoward meddling on Facebook, snagging everyone from Burmese military officers to Russian meme spammers. But curbing such activity has become a very public crusade for Facebook in the wake of its prominent role as a platform for the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and outright hoaxes during the 2016 presidential campaign. This past January, Gleicher <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/removing-cib-iran/">announced</a> the removal of coordinated inauthentic behavior from Iran, which spread when operatives “coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves,” thus triggering a Facebook ban. Similarly, in a 2017 update on Facebook’s internal investigation into Russian online propaganda efforts, the company’s then-head of security Alex Stamos <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/">assured the world’s democracies</a> the company was providing “technology improvements for detecting fake accounts,” including “changes to help us more efficiently detect and stop inauthentic accounts at the time they are being created.”</p>\n<p>Throughout all of this, coordinated inauthentic behavior has remained more or less synonymous with “foreign actors” and “nation-states,” the cloak-and-dagger stuff of an increasingly militarized internet filled with enemies of the Western Democracy who seek to subvert it from abroad.</p>\n<p>Project Veritas, a hybrid of an opposition research shop and a ranting YouTube channel, has taken pride in its ability to deceive since its creation in 2010. With conservative backers like <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/09/22/conservative-facebook-investor-funded-anti-acorn-videographer/">Peter Thiel</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/project-veritas-received-17-million-last-year-from-koch-backed-charity/2017/12/01/143e13ca-d6d3-11e7-9461-ba77d604373d_story.html">Koch brothers</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-foundation-paid-activist-filmmaker-james-o-keefe-n670381">Trump Foundation</a>, the group and its founder James O’Keefe have worked relentlessly to target and malign individuals at institutions they deem leftist, whether it’s Planned Parenthood (reportedly targeted by O&#8217;Keefe<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/04/james-okeefe-undercover-sting-profile-feature-2018-218015"> posing as a young teen&#8217;s 23-year-old boyfriend</a>), George Soros (the progressive philanthropist whose professional circle Veritas tried and<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/james-okeefe-accidentally-stings-himself"> spectacularly failed to infiltrate</a>), or the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.53061302d6db">Washington Post</a> (whose reporter was offered a fake story on Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore). O’Keefe has long attempted to position himself in the context of dogged, daring, traditional journalism, describing Veritas’s efforts as “investigative” reporting executed by “undercover journalists.” But his efforts are often executed by what the New Yorker has called “amateurish spies” — their efforts against the Post and Soros resembled a Three Stooges bit — and packaged with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134525412/Segments-Of-NPR-Gotcha-Video-Taken-Out-Of-Context">mendacious editing</a>, duplicitous production, and outright lying, making Veritas’s audience as much a victim of its productions as the subjects. Debates over who or what is to be considered “real journalism” are almost always counterproductive and contrived, but Veritas stands out for the shamelessness with which it pursues nakedly partisan ends.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, a proud tradition of undercover journalism executed unequivocally in the name of informing the public. Writers like Barbara Ehrenreich and Shane Bauer have taken jobs they were not otherwise interested in in order to reveal injustices in society&#8217;s margins, and some of the most damning details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal were <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/exposed-undercover-secrets-of-donald-trump-data-firm-cambridge-analytica">exposed</a> by a reporter with the UK&#8217;s Channel 4 posing as a foreign politician interested in the company&#8217;s services. This reporting involved lying, sure — or at least the withholding of true intent, and a willingness to let others deceive themselves — but only as a means to a truthful end. The distinction between these reporters and Veritas operatives may be that the end the latter group seeks, the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-a-hollywood-hit-job-how-sting-artist-james-okeefe-tried-to-set-his-latest-trap-and-got-stung-himself">final media product</a>, is <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-648R">typically</a> just another act of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/01/james-okeefe-to-step-up-political-stalking/">partisan misdirection that doesn&#8217;t withstand further scrutiny</a>.</p>\n<p>Neither Project Veritas nor Facebook commented for this story.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Legend Building&#8221; by Project Veritas</h3>\n<p>Project Veritas has <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/11/28/reminder-james-okeefe-has-a-history-of-failing-to-discredit-journalists/">systematically deceived</a> not just <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-okeefe-juan-carlos-vera_n_2832338">targets on the left</a> and <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/fact-check-political-video-misleading">viewers on the right</a> but Facebook users as well (their official page has over 200,000 followers) at a time when the company is publicly dedicated to fighting this sort of systemic duplicity. That’s a wrinkle that raises questions about Facebook’s commitment to rooting out coordinated inauthentic behavior closer to home — Thiel sits on the company’s board — not to mention Project Veritas’s presence on social media.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;We thus have the admission of intent by the organization and evidence of action by multiple of its agents.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>In 2017, O’Keefe sued the Suffolk County district attorney over a Massachusetts law barring the covert recording of government officials. This past December, a federal judge overturned the rule. But in the course of the lawsuit, Joe Halderman, a member of the Project Veritas inner circle who was previously convicted of trying to extort late night television host David Letterman in 2010, sat for a deposition. In it, Halderman was compelled to submit to a sworn interrogation of Veritas methods. Just how does one go about duping savvy politicos and the politico-adjacent in the 21st century?</p>\n<p>During his deposition, Halderman, Project Veritas’s self-described “executive producer,” stated under oath that the organization falsifies Facebook accounts as part of its overall strategy of deceiving the targets of its investigations. Halderman, characterizing himself as “integrally involved in [Project Veritas’s] investigations and have been since I started four years ago,” describes the work that went into setting up Robert Creamer, a Democratic operative recorded by Veritas in a 2016. That video attempted to portray Creamer as complicit in a Hillary Clinton-led campaign to violently disrupt Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign events with counterprotests and engaging in counter-Trump voter fraud — both regular, unfounded talking points repeated by Trump on the campaign trail. Last year, the Wisconsin Department of Justice concluded an investigation into the videos, determining that they “reveal no evidence of election fraud,” the Associated Press reported.</p>\n<p>But before Veritas could get Creamer on camera, they needed to make contact via a fake persona, Halderman explained. Per the transcript (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Q. And you spoke earlier about PVA [Veritas] creating this donor, Charles. When you say create the donor, what did PVA do to create the donor?</p>\n<p>A. So, I thought of a name. I talked to the undercover journalist who was the person who met with Foval. We between us sort of created this story of this person. I got some business cards made. I got an e-mail. I set up an e-mail account. What else did I do? I think that&#8217;s about all I did.</p>\n<p>Again, in this particular case, we didn&#8217;t feel like they were going to get seriously vetted. In some investigations we do legend building because we believe or our concern is that we&#8217;re going to be vetted reasonably, you know, by open source information.</p>\n<p><b>So, we&#8217;ll create a Facebook page</b>, a LinkedIn page. We&#8217;ve even gone so far in the past of creating LLCs, offshore bank accounts. We do a lot of things because undercover journalism is a tricky, complicated business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lauren Windsor, a political organizer and <a href="https://democracypartners.com/partners/lauren-windsor">partner at Democracy Partners</a> (alongside Robert Creamer) who began documenting Veritas’s team of “undercover” operatives and their various aliases after her own organization was infiltrated, this sort of use of phony social accounts is the group’s standard operating procedure. “In conducting extensive outreach to victims and extensive research of social media networks to build the vetting resource website <a href="https://www.projectveritas.exposed/"><span lang="en-US">Project Veritas Exposed</span></a>,&#8221; explained Windsor, &#8220;I documented several instances of PV violating Facebook’s terms by creating fake profiles. We thus have the admission of intent by the organization and evidence of action by multiple of its agents.”</p>\n<p>Windsor’s work includes cataloging Project Veritas&#8217;s network of fake Facebook accounts; Windsor provided screenshots to The Intercept. In one example, Veritas operative Marisa Jorge’s likeness is used for the Facebook profile of “Ava-Marie Joyce.” The bio of the Ava-Marie persona bizarrely describes herself as “Carrie Tallinn, a self-employed professional women’s right activist.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2018 lawsuit <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/07/23/project-veritas-lawsuit-american-federation-of-teachers/">reported</a> by The Intercept last year, Jorge previously misrepresented herself as a University of Michigan student in order to gain improper access to teachers union documents. The friends list for “Ava-Marie Joyce” lists another profile fabricated by Project Veritas, “Ava Marie Allen.”</p>\n<p>Another screenshot shows a Facebook profile for “Tyler Marshall,” which O’Keefe himself disclosed as a fabricated identity in his 2018 book “American Pravda.” In a section of that book (subtitle: “My Fight For Truth in the Era of Fake News”) detailing Veritas’s attempts to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/meetings-of-activists-planning-to-disrupt-inauguration-were-infiltrated-by-conservative-media-group/2017/01/24/b22128fe-e19a-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.67af0c45d3ca">infiltrate protestors planning action</a> around Trump&#8217;s presidential inauguration, O’Keefe wrote that his operatives all “of course, establish a social media presence under their assumed names—‘Tyler Marshall,’ say, or ‘Adam Stevens.’ The presence includes Twitter, Facebook, and email at the least.”</p>\n<h3>Exploitation of Facebook by a Group Linked To Military Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, said Veritas’s homegrown social media deception is a clear violation of Facebook’s policy. After reading the deposition, Brooking told The Intercept, “Mr. Halderman describes the creation of fake Facebook personas for the purpose of deception” and “implies that this is a regular and systematic practice. Under any reasonable definition, Project Veritas is engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior and abuse of the Facebook platform.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>&#8220;Under any reasonable definition, Project Veritas is engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior and abuse of the Facebook platform.”</blockquote>\n<p>Brooking’s group, a frequently cited authority on online electoral interference and other digital propaganda campaigns, entered into an official partnership with Facebook last year. A Facebook director <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/announcing-new-election-partnership-with-the-atlantic-council/">wrote at the time</a> that experts at the lab “will work closely with our security, policy and product teams to get Facebook real-time insights and updates on emerging threats and disinformation campaigns from around the world.”</p>\n<p>If it sounds like a stretch to compare Project Veritas to a Russian troll farm, consider the group&#8217;s links to the U.S. defense establishment. As The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/03/erik-prince-trump-uae-project-veritas/">reported in May</a>, Veritas members underwent “intelligence and elicitation techniques from a retired military intelligence operative named Euripides Rubio Jr.,” personally arranged by the infamous American mercenary and Trump adviser Erik Prince. What we have here, then, is a 2016 military intelligence-linked, organized effort to undermine the Democratic Party and boost the Trump presidential campaign using falsified social media profiles. If that doesn’t sound familiar, it certainly should.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>The problem with Facebook and its peers has never been identifying abuses and misuses, whether truly dangerous or merely toxic; Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone represent perhaps history&#8217;s greatest living catalog of antisocial behavior, a frenzy of rule violation on a mass scale. Whether these companies deem comprehensive content moderation simply too expensive or not worth the public relations mess, the fact is that the public rarely sees movement on these issues in the absence of congressional scolding or media uproar.</p>\n<p>The real issue is uneven, arbitrary enforcement of &#8220;the rules.&#8221; Max Read, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/carlos-maza-and-stephen-crowder-show-youtube-has-one-rule.html">writing in New York magazine</a> on another social network&#8217;s enforcement blunders, argued that &#8220;the problem for YouTube is that for rules to be taken seriously by the people they govern, they need to be applied consistently and clearly.&#8221; YouTube is about as terrible at this exercise as Facebook is, and there&#8217;s a good chance that if Facebook treated malicious right-wing American exploitation of its network the same way it treats malicious foreign exploitation of its network, it would probably botch the whole thing and end up burning people who actually do use phony Facebook profiles<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/us/politics/facebook-first-amendment.html"> for work toward the public good</a>.</p>\n<p>That a company like Facebook is even in a position to create &#8220;rules&#8221; like the coordinated inauthentic behavior policy that apply to a large chunk of the Earth&#8217;s population is itself a serious problem, one made considerably worse by completely erratic enforcement. It&#8217;s bad enough having a couple guys in California take up the banner of defending &#8220;Democracy&#8221; around the world through the exclusive control of one of the most powerful information organs in human history; if nothing else, we should hope their decisions are predictable and consistent.</p>\n<p>Correction: June 11th, 2019, 11:19 a.m.</p>\n<p>This article has been updated to name Lauren Windsor’s employer, Democracy Partners, where she is a partner.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/11/facebook-rules-project-veritas/">Right-Wing Sting Group Project Veritas Is Breaking Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Authentic Behavior&#8221; Rule.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>In January 2017,</u> three days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a businessman from the United Arab Emirates was invited to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-opulent-trump-inaugural-dinner-designed-as-a-glittery-overture-to-foreign-diplomats/2019/03/14/e20c8482-3f5d-11e9-a0d3-1210e58a94cf_story.html?utm_term=.591260a3cb31">a lavish dinner</a> planned by Trump&#8217;s longtime ally Thomas J. Barrack Jr., who was chair of the president&#8217;s inaugural committee. The guest list placed Rashid al-Malik, a onetime business associate of Barrack’s, amid more than 100 foreign diplomats and top members of the incoming administration. The president-elect himself made a surprise appearance at the gathering.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik’s name later surfaced in connection with a federal probe into potential <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html">illegal donations to Trump’s inaugural fund and a pro-Trump Super PAC by Middle Eastern donors</a>. Al-Malik was interviewed by members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s team and was “cooperating” with prosecutors, his lawyer told The Intercept last year. The New York Times recently reported that investigators are looking into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/world/middleeast/crown-prince-mohammed-bin-zayed.html">whether Mr. al-Malik was part of an illegal influence scheme</a>,” although no details of that potential scheme have been made public.</p>\n<p>In fact, the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that al-Malik served as a paid intelligence source for the UAE throughout 2017, The Intercept has learned.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="killing" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>Al-Malik reported to UAE intelligence about aspects of the Trump administration’s Middle East policy, according to a former U.S. official and documents viewed by The Intercept. The National Intelligence Service of the UAE gave al-Malik a code name and paid him tens of thousands of dollars a month to gather information, a role for which his investment business would have provided a convenient cover.</p>\n<p>After he was interviewed as part of the Mueller investigation, al-Malik left Los Angeles, where he’d been based for several years, and went back to the UAE.</p>\n<p>A former Dubai aerospace executive and chair of the investment firm Hayah Holdings, al-Malik was tasked to report to his Emirati intelligence handlers on topics of consequence to the UAE, such as attitudes within the Trump administration toward the Muslim Brotherhood; U.S. efforts to mediate the ongoing feud between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar; and meetings between senior U.S. officials and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose rise to power has been loudly championed by the UAE and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik also told his handlers that he had approached unnamed U.S. individuals about a possible business venture that was indirectly associated with Trump. It is not clear what the undertaking was, who al-Malik was talking to, or whether any deal was made.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik “is not an intelligence operative,” his attorney, Bill Coffield, of Berliner Corcoran &amp; Rowe, told The Intercept. “Mr. al-Malik is a businessman involved in many business projects, and he is regularly paid for business consulting,” Coffield wrote in an email. “He has NEVER been paid to report on the Trump Administration. He has never been ‘tasked’ to deliver information about the inner workings of the Trump administration.”</p>\n<p>U.S. counterintelligence officials regularly monitor foreign governments’ efforts to influence U.S. policy, but an operation by the UAE would be particularly sensitive for the Trump administration, and would underscore the hazards posed by a president whose ongoing business ties expose him to potential conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization has made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/business/trump-golf-course-dubai.html">millions per year</a> off a Trump-branded golf course in Dubai. Shortly after he was elected, Trump bragged that he turned down a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-says-he-turned-down-2-billion-deal-in-dubai-but-didnt-have-to/2017/01/11/f9092f56-d82f-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html?utm_term=.3fb31c762200">$2 billion deal</a> from his Dubai-based business partner, Hussain Sajwani.</p>\n<p>It is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/951">against the law</a> for anyone other than a diplomatic or consular official to operate inside the United States on behalf of a foreign government without first notifying the Justice Department, though the law includes exceptions for “officially and publicly acknowledged and sponsored” foreign government representatives and those “engaged in a legal commercial transaction.” Earlier this year, Russian national Maria Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to form “backchannel” connections between conservative U.S. officials and the Kremlin as an undisclosed agent of the Russian government. She was sentenced to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/maria-butina-russian-who-conspired-to-infiltrate-the-nra-due-for-sentencing/2019/04/25/3ff24216-66ce-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html?utm_term=.aafb67ae1caf">18 months in prison</a> and will be deported when she has completed her sentence.</p>\n<p>The White House declined to comment, referring questions to the CIA and the Justice Department, both of which also declined to comment. The UAE Embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Among the Emirati government officials overseeing al-Malik was Ali al-Shamsi, director of the Emirati National Intelligence Service, according to The Intercept&#8217;s sources. A source who knows al-Shamsi described him as “more than just a spy. He’s also a discreet messenger” for Mohammed bin Zayed, known as MBZ, and his brother Tahnoun bin Zayed, the UAE’s national security adviser.</p>\n<p>“Al-Shamsi and the Emirati government clearly think they can influence Trump by doing business with him,” said a person with direct knowledge of UAE intelligence operations who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.</p>\n<p><u></u><div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253845" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_17135646364787-trump-mbz-1559952086.jpg" alt="President Donald Trump welcomes Abu Dhabi\'s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to the White House in Washington, Monday, May 15, 2017.

He has openly shared his beliefs that the best way to forge a stronger bond is through economic prosperity.”</p>\n<p>Al-Malik “has, on numerous occasions, discussed various business ideas for UAE projects in the U.S.,&#8221; Coffield continued. &#8220;He has consistently discussed highlighting the economic benefits of UAE investment in the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation, as a way to foster a better relationship between the citizens of both countries. His discussions also included the benefits for both countries’ leadership.”</p>\n<p>A tiny country of fewer than 10 million people, the UAE does not have a robust intelligence service, but has used businesspeople and wealthy citizens with personal relationships with its royal families as assets to carry out secret intelligence-gathering missions for the government, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik was likely enlisted as a spy “because he has pre-existing access, a natural role,” said the person with knowledge of UAE intelligence operations.</p>\n<p>Coffield did not respond to The Intercept’s request to interview al-Malik.</p>\n<p>Whether or not al-Malik’s efforts succeeded, the small, oil-rich Gulf nation has indisputably triumphed during the Trump presidency, as its top foreign policy goals have repeatedly won Trump’s personal backing. In 2017, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/06/qatar-panic-buying-as-shoppers-stockpile-food-due-to-saudi-blockade">tweeted in support</a> of Saudi and UAE efforts to isolate their Gulf rival Qatar, publicly contradicting his own cabinet. With Congressional opposition holding up arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE after Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered by a hit team in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Trump administration <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/24/us-saudi-arabia-arms-sales/">invoked an obscure emergency provision</a> to allow the deals to go forward. Trump also <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/18/trump-veto-yemen-saudi-arabia-mbs/">vetoed</a> a resolution that would have ended U.S. military support for the Saudi- and UAE-led intervention in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians; his White House has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/trump-muslim-brotherhood.html">pushed to designate the Muslim Brotherhood</a> a foreign terrorist organization, a move that has long been sought by the UAE and its Gulf allies.</p>\n<p><u>Little is publicly</u> known about al-Malik, who began his career as a pilot for Emirates, Dubai’s government-owned airline. He came to the U.S. in 1998 to study aviation at Western Michigan University and was honored by the UAE Embassy in Washington for scholastic achievement in the program, according to a profile on an <a href="http://www.arabaviation.com/IndustryResources/WhosWho/tabid/54/ItemId/502/Rashid-Al-Malik.aspx">industry website</a>. But he left the university in 2000 without receiving a degree, according to the Western Michigan registrar’s office.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik worked as an Emirates pilot from 2000 to 2006, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashid-al-malik-19bbaa11/?originalSubdomain=ae">his LinkedIn page</a>, before becoming an executive at Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, a government-funded company that leases aircraft. Al-Malik left that job in 2008, and now runs Hayah Holdings.</p>\n<p>It is unclear when and how al-Malik met Barrack, a billionaire investor who was one of Trump’s top fundraisers during the 2016 campaign. But in 2013, al-Malik and Barrack, who is executive chair of Colony Capital, Inc., tried to partner on <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/04/10/quan-dubai-prince-partnering-on-oaklands-coliseum-city/">a real estate deal</a> to revitalize downtown Oakland and possibly build new sports stadiums and hotels. Colony Capital and Hayah Holdings formed a joint investment venture called Bay Investment Group LLC, but the deal ultimately fell through.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253840" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-631421232-1559951301.jpg" alt="Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Barrack, founder of Colony Capital LLC and chairman of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\'s inaugural committee, speaks to members of the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017.

The Times reported last summer that Barrack’s company has raised more than $7 billion in new investments since Trump won the Republican nomination, with roughly a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/world/middleeast/trump-tom-barrack-saudi.html">quarter of the money</a> coming from Gulf states.</p>\n<p>Barrack has also cultivated a friendly relationship with <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/23/yousef-al-otaiba-khashoggi-washington/">Yousef al-Otaiba</a>, the UAE’s powerful ambassador to the United States. In April 2016, months after then-candidate Trump proposed a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” al-Otaiba wrote to Barrack saying that “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/world/middleeast/trump-tom-barrack-saudi.html">confusion about your friend Donald Trump is VERY high</a>” and “has many people extremely worried,” according to email correspondence published by the Times and other outlets.</p>\n<p>Barrack sought to reassure al-Otaiba, saying that Trump “also has joint ventures in the U.A.E.!” He added, “We can turn him to prudence &#8211; he needs a few really smart Arab minds to whom he can confer &#8211; u r at the top of that list!”</p>\n<p>Al-Otaiba was also on the guest list for the Chairman’s Global Dinner, the extravagant inaugural event to which al-Malik was invited. The dinner was unusual not just because of its opulence but because it seated so many foreign businesspeople and diplomats alongside future cabinet-level officials, providing direct access to members of the incoming administration.</p>\n<p>A week after Trump won the election, al-Otaiba sought insider information from Barrack. “If you have any insights about postings to places like state, DOD, CIA and national security adviser, I would be grateful,” al-Otaiba emailed Barrack on November 16, 2016, <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/donald-trump-campaign-and-uae-emails-yousef-otaiba-tom-barrack-reveal-sharing-information-2016-election-saudi-9/11-1631521788">according to Middle East Eye</a>. “I would only brief my bosses. Any indicators would be highly appreciated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Barrack responded, “I do, and we’re working through them in real time and I have our regional interest in high profile.

Instead, he stayed with his investment firm, which contemplated a plan to channel his foreign connections into lucrative deals that would support Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit">published a February 2017 memo</a> from Barrack’s firm, Colony Capital, then known as Colony Northstar, outlining the scheme to leverage connections to the Trump administration and foreign VIPs for profit. The plan was reportedly written by Rick Gates, Paul Manafort’s longtime associate, who served as deputy chair of the inaugural committee and then as a Colony consultant. Gates was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-30/rick-gates-terminated-by-barrack-s-colony-following-indictment">fired by Colony</a> after being indicted in the Mueller probe; he ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the Washington DC office is to expand Colony Northstar’s global footprint and build a bridge to where government and business intersect globally,” the memo says. “The key is to strategically cultivate domestic and international relations while avoiding any appearance of lobbying.” The memo notes that no other company “can currently match the relationships and resources that we possess.” A Colony spokesperson told ProPublica that the plan was “never acted upon or implemented.”</p>\n<p>A source close to Barrack told The Intercept that al-Malik and Barrack spoke several times in 2018, but that Barrack did not have any current business deals with al-Malik.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>There is no indication that Barrack knew about al-Malik’s intelligence role. But Tommy Davis, a former chief of staff to Barrack who represents him as a spokesperson, was aware that al-Malik had connections to the UAE government.</p>\n<p>“I know for a fact that Rashid has been on retainer since the day I met him, and he’s always been clear about that,” Davis told The Intercept. “That’s who pays for his car, that’s who pays for where he lives. And his job is to be on retainer and to find and consummate real estate deals in the United States.”</p>\n<p>Hayah Holdings does not appear to have a website or a physical address in Dubai, but documents from the city of Oakland described it as a “a private investment company based in Dubai with strong financial ties in the Gulf region.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Malik formed Hayah Holdings to help identify investment and development opportunities in established markets such as the United States and Europe,” according to a 2013 document from the Oakland city administrator’s office. “Their focus has primarily been on large mixed-use real estate developments, especially those of a transformational nature and with a significant sport, entertainment content and infrastructure related opportunities [sic].”</p>\n<p>Jean Quan, who was mayor of Oakland when the deal was being considered, said she was told that the financing came from Emirati royals. “What was conveyed to me at the time was that the money for the deal was going to come from the Dubai royal family,” Quan told The Intercept.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/10/trump-uae-businessman-spy/">UAE Enlisted Businessman to Spy On Trump White House</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>A large trove</u> of documents furnished exclusively to The Intercept Brasil reveals serious ethical violations and legally prohibited collaboration between the judge and prosecutors who last year <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/24/lula-brazil-corruption-conviction-car-wash/">convicted</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/13/brazil-lula-prison-generals-military-coup/">imprisoned</a> former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on corruption charges — a conviction that resulted in Lula being barred from the 2018 presidential election. These materials also contain evidence that the prosecution had serious doubts about whether there was sufficient evidence to establish Lula’s guilt.</p>\n<p>The archive, provided to The Intercept by an anonymous source, includes years of internal files and private conversations from the prosecutorial team behind Brazil&#8217;s sprawling Operation Car Wash, an ongoing corruption investigation that has yielded dozens of major convictions, including those of top corporate executives and powerful politicians.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="secret-brazil-archive" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>In the files, conversations between lead prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol and then-presiding Judge Sergio Moro reveal that Moro offered strategic advice to prosecutors and passed on tips for new avenues of investigation. With these actions, Moro grossly overstepped the ethical lines that define the role of a judge. In Brazil, as in the United States, judges are required to be impartial and neutral, and are barred from secretly collaborating with one side in a case.</p>\n<p>Other chats in the archive raise fundamental questions about the quality of the charges that ultimately sent Lula to prison. He was accused of having received a beachfront triplex apartment from a contractor as a kickback for facilitating multimillion-dollar contracts with the state-controlled oil firm Petrobras. In group chats among members of the prosecutorial team just days before filing the indictment, Dallagnol expressed his increasing doubts over two key elements of the prosecution&#8217;s case: whether the triplex was in fact Lula&#8217;s and whether it had anything to do with Petrobras.</p>\n<p>These two questions were critical to their ability to prosecute Lula. Without the Petrobras link, the task force running the Car Wash investigation would have no legal basis for prosecuting this case, as it would fall outside of their jurisdiction. Even more seriously, without proving that the triplex belonged to Lula, the case itself would fall apart, since Lula’s alleged receipt of the triplex was the key ingredient to prove he acted corruptly.</p>\n<p>Operation Car Wash is one of the most consequential political forces in the history of Brazilian democracy and also one of the most controversial. It has taken down powerful actors once thought to be untouchable and revealed massive corruption schemes that sucked billions out of public coffers.</p>\n<p>The probe, however, has also been accused of political bias, repeated violations of constitutional guarantees, and illegal leaks of information to the press. (A separate article <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula">published today</a> by The Intercept reveals that the Car Wash prosecutors, who long insisted that they were apolitical and concerned solely with fighting corruption, were in fact internally plotting how to prevent the return to power by Lula and his Workers&#8217; Party).</p>\n<p>The successful prosecution of Lula rendered him ineligible to run in the 2018 presidential election at a time when all polls showed that the former president was the clear frontrunner. As a result, Operation Car Wash was scorned by Lula&#8217;s supporters, who considered it a politically motivated scheme, driven by right-wing ideologues masquerading as apolitical anti-corruption prosecutors, in order to prevent Lula from running for president and to destroy the Workers&#8217; Party.</p>\n<p>But on the Brazilian right, there was widespread popular support for the corruption probe, the team of prosecutors, and Moro. The yearslong corruption probe transformed Moro into a hero both in Brazil and around the world, a status that was only strengthened once he became the man who finally brought down Lula.</p>\n<p>After the guilty verdict from Moro was quickly affirmed by an appellate court, Lula’s candidacy was barred by law. With Lula out of the running, the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/28/jair-bolsonaro-elected-president-brazil/">far-right </a>candidate Jair Bolsonaro shot up in the polls and then <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/05/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election-stabbinng/">handily</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/08/brazils-bolsonaro-led-far-right-wins-a-victory-far-more-sweeping-and-dangerous-than-anyone-predicted-its-lessons-are-global/">won the presidency</a> by defeating Lula’s chosen replacement, former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro then named Moro, the judge who had presided over the case against Lula, to be his justice minister. Jurists and scholars will continue to debate the role of Car Wash for decades, but these archives offer an unprecedented window into this crucial moment in recent Brazilian history.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254032" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-942784120-moro-lava-jato-1560058067.jpg" alt="View of a truck with a portrait of Brazilian judge Sergio Moro reading &quot;Long live Lava Jato&quot;, referring to an anti-corrption operation, during a protest against Brazilian former president (2003-2011) Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva outside the Federal Police headquarters, where he is awaited to start his 12-year prison sentence in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.

Over the course of more than two years, Moro suggested to the prosecutor that his team change the sequence of who they would investigate; insisted on less downtime between raids; gave strategic advice and informal tips; provided the prosecutors with advance knowledge of his decisions; offered constructive criticism of prosecutorial filings; and even scolded Dallagnol as if the prosecutor worked for the judge. Such conduct is unethical for a judge, who is responsible for maintaining neutrality to guarantee a fair trial, and it violates the Judiciary&#8217;s Code of Ethics for Brazil.</p>\n<p>In one illustrative chat, Moro, referring to new rounds of search warrants and interrogations, suggested to Dallagnol that it might be preferable to “reverse the order of the two planned [phases].&#8221;</p>\n<p>Numerous other instances in this archive reveal Moro — then a judge, and now Bolsonaro’s justice minister — actively collaborating with the prosecutors to strengthen their case. After a month of silence from the Car Wash task force, Moro asked: &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it been a long time without an operation?&#8221; In another instance, Moro said, &#8220;You cannot make that kind of mistake now&#8221; — a reference to what he considered to be an error by the Federal Police. &#8220;But think hard whether that&#8217;s a good idea… the facts would have to be serious,&#8221; he counseled after Dallagnol told him of a motion he planned to file. &#8220;What do you think of these crazy statements from the PT national board? Should we officially rebut?&#8221; he asked, using the plural — &#8220;we&#8221; — in response to criticisms of the Car Wash investigation by Lula&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party, showing that he viewed himself and the Car Wash prosecutors as united in the same cause.</p>\n<p>As in the United States, Brazil&#8217;s criminal justice system employs the accusatory model, which requires separation between the accuser and judge. Under this model, the judge must analyze the allegations of both sides in an impartial, disinterested manner. But the chats between Moro and Dallagnol show that, when he was a judge, the current justice minister improperly interfered in the Car Wash task force&#8217;s work, acting informally as an aid and advisor to the prosecution. In secret, he was helping design and construct the very criminal case that he would then “neutrally” adjudicate.</p>\n<p>Such coordination between the judge and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office outside of official proceedings squarely contradicts the public narrative that Car Wash prosecutors, Moro, and their supporters have presented and vigorously defended over the years. Moro and Dallagnol have been accused of secret collaboration since the early days of Car Wash, but these suspicions — until now — were not backed by concrete evidence.</p>\n<p>Another example of Moro crossing the line separating prosecutor and judge is in a conversation with Dallagnol on December 7, 2015, when he informally passed on a tip about Lula&#8217;s case to the prosecutors. &#8220;So. The following. Source informed me that the contact person is annoyed at having been asked to issue draft property transfer deeds for one of the ex-president&#8217;s children. Apparently the person would be willing to provide the information. I&#8217;m therefore passing it along. The source is serious,&#8221; wrote Moro.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thank you!! We&#8217;ll make contact,&#8221; Dallagnol promptly replied. Moro added, &#8220;And it would be dozens of properties.&#8221; Dallagnol later advised Moro that he called the source, but she would not talk: &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of drafting a subpoena, based on apocryphal news,&#8221; the prosecutor said. While it is not entirely clear what this means, it appears that Dallagnol was floating the idea of inventing an anonymous complaint that could be used to compel the source to testify. Moro, rather than chastise the prosecutor or remain silent, appears to endorse the proposal: &#8220;Better to formalize then,&#8221; the judge replied.</p>\n<p>Moro has publicly and vehemently denied on several occasions that he ever worked in partnership with the team of prosecutors. In a March 2016 <a href="https://youtu.be/8mMwU37tPUU?list=PLTBJf5VvlFLNnhTWhW6ngfvc4vZg3qOct&amp;t=3714">speech</a>, Moro denied these suspicions explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s make something very clear. You hear a lot about Judge Moro&#8217;s investigative strategy. [&#8230;] I do not have any investigative strategy at all. The people who investigate or who decide what to do and such is the Public Prosecutor and the [Federal] Police. The judge is reactive. We say that a judge should normally cultivate these passive virtues. And I even get irritated at times, I see somewhat unfounded criticism of my work, saying that I am a judge-investigator.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In his <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/luta-contra-corrup%C3%A7%C3%A3o-marcado-impunidade/dp/8568377106/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1559751637&amp;refinements=p_27%3ADeltan+Dallagnol&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">2017 book</a>, &#8220;The Fight Against Corruption,&#8221; Dallagnol wrote that Moro &#8220;always evaluated the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s requests in an impartial and technical manner.&#8221; Last year, in response to a complaint from Lula&#8217;s lawyers, Brazil&#8217;s prosecutor general — the presidentially-appointed chief prosecutor who runs the Car Wash investigation — <a href="http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/justica/noticia/2018-07/pgr-envia-parecer-contra-suspeicao-de-moro-para-stj">wrote</a> that Moro &#8220;remained impartial during the entire process&#8221; of Lula&#8217;s conviction.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254034" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-887666420-dallagnol-1560058347.jpg" alt="Brazilian Federal Attorney Deltan Dallagnol listens, during the ceremony for the return of resources to Petrobras, which were recovered through cooperation and leniency agreements  in connection with Lava Jato operation, in Curitiba, Brazil on December 07, 2017.

They also knew that their claimed jurisdictional entitlement to prosecute Lula was shaky at best, if not entirely baseless.</p>\n<p>In the documents, Dallagnol, the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, expressed concerns regarding the two most important elements of the prosecution’s case. Their indictment accused Lula of receiving a beachfront triplex apartment from the construction firm Grupo OAS as a bribe in exchange for facilitating millions of dollars in contracts with Petrobras, but they lacked solid documentary evidence to prove that the apartment was Lula’s or that he ever facilitated any contracts. Without the apartment, there was no case, and without the Petrobras link, the case would fall out of their jurisdiction and into that of the São Paulo division of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office, which had argued that it, rather than Operation Car Wash prosecutors, had jurisdiction over the case against Lula.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They will say that we are accusing based on newspaper articles and fragile evidence &#8230; so it&#8217;d be good if this item is wrapped up tight. Apart from this item, so far I am apprehensive about the connection between Petrobras and enrichment, and after they told me I am apprehensive about the apartment story,&#8221; wrote Dallagnol in a group Telegram chat with his colleagues on September 9, 2016, four days before filing their indictment against Lula. &#8220;These are points in which we have to have solid answers and on the tips of our tongues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>None of Dallagnol&#8217;s subordinates responded to his messages in the materials examined for this article.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors in São Paulo had <a href="https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2016/03/16/interna_politica,743959/promotores-de-sp-que-querem-lula-na-cadeia-recorrem-contra-decisao-de.shtml">publicly questioned</a> the Petrobras connection in an official court filing, noting, &#8220;In 2009-2010 there was no talk of scandal at Petrobras. In 2005, when the presidential couple, in theory, began to pay installments on the property, there was no indication of an &#8216;oil scandal&#8217;.”</p>\n<p>The Curitiba-based Car Wash team eventually prevailed over their São Paulo counterparts and were able to maintain the high-profile, politically explosive case in their jurisdiction. But private chats reveal that their argument was a bluff — they weren&#8217;t actually sure of the Petrobras link that was the key to maintaining their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night at 10:45 p.m., a day after expressing his original doubts, Dallagnol messaged the group again: &#8220;I&#8217;m so horny for this O GLOBO article from 2010. I&#8217;m going to kiss whichever one of you found this.&#8221; The <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/caso-bancoop-triplex-do-casal-lula-esta-atrasado-3041591">article</a>, headlined &#8220;Bancoop Case: Lula Couple&#8217;s Triplex Is Delayed,&#8221; was the first to publicly mention Lula owning an apartment in Guarujá, a coastal town in São Paulo state. The 645-word article, published years before the Car Wash investigation began, does not mention OAS or Petrobras and instead covers the bankruptcy of the construction cooperative behind the development and how it could negatively impact the delivery date of Lula&#8217;s new vacation apartment.</p>\n<p>The article was submitted as evidence and, in his decision to convict Lula, Moro wrote that the O Globo article &#8220;is quite relevant from a probative point of view.&#8221; But Lula’s defense attorneys dispute that he was the owner of a triplex, claiming instead that he purchased a smaller, single level apartment on a lower floor, and the O Globo article presented no documentation proving otherwise.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is a small but telling inconsistency between the O Globo article and the claims of the prosecution regarding the triplex. The article itself puts Lula’s penthouse in Tower B, and even notes that Tower A is yet to be built at the time the article was written: “The second tower, if constructed according to the project blueprints, finalized in the early 2000s, may end part of Lula’s joy: the building will be in front of the president&#8217;s property, obstructing his ocean view at Guarujá.” But the prosecutors alleged that Lula owned the beachfront triplex in Tower A. Without noting this contradiction, Item 191 of the indictment cites the O Globo article: “This article explained that the then President LULA and [his wife] MARISA LETÍCIA would receive a triplex penthouse, with a view to the sea, in the said venture.&#8221; That is the apartment that would eventually be seized by authorities and that Lula would be convicted of receiving.</p>\n<p>Car Wash prosecutors used the article as evidence that the triplex belonged to the presidential family, but indicted and convicted Lula on a triplex in a different building — demonstrating that the investigation was imprecise on the central point of their case: identifying the bribe that Lula allegedly received from the contractor.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>When the indictment was revealed during a press conference on September 14, the triplex and its provenance as a bribe from OAS were the key pieces of evidence on the charges of passive corruption and money laundering. In a now infamous moment, Dallagnol presented a typo-laden PowerPoint presentation that showed &#8220;Lula&#8221; written in a blue bubble surrounded by 14 other bubbles containing everything from “Lula’s reaction” and “expressiveness” to “illicit enrichment” and “bribeocracy.” All arrows pointed back to Lula, whom they characterized as the mastermind behind a sprawling criminal enterprise. The presentation was widely spoofed and criticized by critics as evidence of the weakness of the Car Wash prosecutors&#8217; case.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="pt" dir="ltr">O PowerPoint de Deltan Dallagnol foi corroborado no TRF-4. <a href="https://t.co/qFCU9UbWe5">https://t.co/qFCU9UbWe5</a> <a href="https://t.co/2Kd7LQKBpY">pic.twitter.com/2Kd7LQKBpY</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; O Antagonista (@o_antagonista) <a href="https://twitter.com/o_antagonista/status/956167537347067904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>Two days later, Dallagnol messaged Moro and, in private, explained that they went to great lengths to characterize Lula as the &#8220;maximum leader&#8221; of the corruption scheme as a way to link the politician to the R$87 million (US$26.7 million, at the time) paid in bribes by OAS for contracts at two Petrobras refineries — a charge without material evidence, he admitted, but one that was essential so that the case could be tried under Moro&#8217;s jurisdiction in Curitiba.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The indictment is based on a lot of indirect evidence of authorship, but it wouldn’t fit to say that in the indictment and in our communications we avoided that point,&#8221; Dallagnol wrote. &#8220;It was not understood that the long exposition on command of the scheme was necessary to impute corruption to the former president. A lot of people did not understand why we put him as the leader to gain 3,7MM in money laundering, when it was not for that, but to impute 87MM of corruption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moro responded two days later: “Definitely, the criticisms of your presentation are disproportionate. Stand firm.&#8221; Less than a year later, the judge sentenced the former president to nine years and six months in prison. The ruling was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/24/lula-brazil-corruption-conviction-car-wash/">quickly upheld</a> unanimously by an appeals court and the sentence was extended to 12 years and one month. In an interview, the president of the appeals court <a href="https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/politica/noticia/2017/08/apos-elogiar-sentenca-de-moro-presidente-do-trf4-afirma-que-lula-tera-julgamento-justo-e-imparcial-9863616.html">characterized</a> Moro’s decision as “just and impartial” before later admitting that he had not yet obtained access to the underlying evidence in the case. One of the three judges on the panel was an <a href="http://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/eles-vao-julgar-lula/">old friend and classmate</a> of Moro’s.</p>\n<p>Even Lula’s most vehement critics, including those who believe him to be corrupt, have expressed doubts about the strength of this particular conviction. Many have argued that it was chosen as the first case because it was simple enough to process quickly, in time to fulfill the real goal: to bar Lula from being re-elected.</p>\n<p>Until now, most of the evidence necessary to evaluate the motives and internal beliefs of the Car Wash task force and Moro remained secret. Reporting on this archive now finally enables the public — in Brazil and internationally — to evaluate both the validity of Lula’s conviction and the propriety of those who worked so tirelessly to bring it about.</p>\n<p>The Intercept contacted the offices of the Car Wash task force and Sergio Moro immediately upon publication and will update the stories with their comments if and when they provide them. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-archive-operation-car-wash">Read the editors&#8217; statement here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 9, 2019, 8:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Car Wash task force did not refute the authenticity of the information published by The Intercept.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>An enormous trove</u> of secret documents reveals that Brazil’s most powerful prosecutors, who have spent years insisting they are apolitical, instead plotted to prevent the Workers&#8217; Party, or PT, from winning the 2018 presidential election by blocking or weakening a pre-election interview with former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva with the explicit purpose of affecting the outcome of the election.</p>\n<p>The massive archive, provided exclusively to The Intercept, shows multiple examples of politicized abuse of prosecutorial powers by those who led the country&#8217;s sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption probe since 2014. It also reveals a long-denied political and ideological agenda. One glaring example occurred 10 days before the first round of presidential voting last year, when a Supreme Court justice granted a petition from the country’s largest newspaper, Folha de São Paulo, to interview Lula, who was in prison on corruption charges brought by the Car Wash task force.</p>\n<p>Immediately upon learning of that decision on September 28, 2018, the team of prosecutors who handled Lula’s corruption case — who spent years vehemently denying that they were driven by political motives of any kind — began discussing in a private Telegram chat group how to block, subvert, or undermine the Supreme Court decision. This was based on their expressed fear that the decision would help the PT — Lula’s party — win the election. Based on their stated desire to prevent the PT&#8217;s return to power, they spent hours debating strategies to prevent or dilute the political impact of Lula’s interview.</p>\n<p>The Car Wash prosecutors explicitly said that their motive in stopping Lula’s interview was to prevent the PT from winning. One of the prosecutors, Laura Tessler, exclaimed upon learning of the decision, “What a joke!” and then explained the urgency of preventing or undermining the decision. “A press conference before the second round of voting could help elect Haddad,” she wrote in the chat group, referring to the PT&#8217;s candidate Fernando Haddad. The chief of the prosecutor task force, Deltan Dallagnol, conducted a separate conversation with a longtime confidant, also a prosecutor, and they agreed that they would “pray” together that the events of that day would not usher in the PT’s return to power.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="secret-brazil-archive" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>Many in Brazil have long accused the Car Wash prosecutors, as well as the judge who adjudicated the corruption cases, Sérgio Moro (now the country’s justice minister under President Jair Bolsonaro), of being driven by ideological and political motives. Moro and the Car Wash team have repeatedly denied these accusations, insisting that their only consideration was to expose and punish political corruption irrespective of party or political faction.</p>\n<p>But this new archive of documents — some of which are being published today in other articles by The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil — casts considerable doubt on the denials of the prosecutors. Indeed, many of these documents show <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">improper and unethical plotting between Dallagnol and Moro</a> on how to best structure the corruption case against Lula — although Moro was legally required to judge the case as a neutral arbiter. Other documents include <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">private admissions among the prosecutors</a> that the evidence proving Lula’s guilt was lacking. Overall, the documents depict a task force of prosecutors seemingly intent on exploiting its legal powers for blatantly political ends, led by its goal of preventing a return to power of the Workers&#8217; Party generally, and Lula specifically.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253988" src="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-1093835456-sergio-moro-1560054130.jpg" alt="Sergio Moro, Brazil\'s minister of Justice, speaks during a news conference in Brasilia, Brazil, on Monday, Feb. 4, 2019.

But this new archive of documents shines substantial light on previously unreported motives, actions, and often deceitful maneuvering by these powerful actors.</p>\n<p>While the Car Wash team of prosecutors has imprisoned a wide range of powerful politicians and billionaires, by far their most significant accomplishment was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/americas/brazil-lula-surrenders-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-.html">the 2018 imprisonment of Lula</a>. At the time of Lula’s conviction, all polls showed that the former president — who had twice been elected by large margins, in 2002 and then again in 2006, and left office with a 87 percent approval rate — was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/16/lula-da-silva-is-in-jail-and-hes-still-brazils-leading-candidate-for-president-here-are-3-ways-that-could-turn-out/?utm_term=.b565bbe7a708">the overwhelming frontrunner</a> to once again win the presidency in 2018.</p>\n<p>But Lula’s criminal conviction last year, once it was quickly affirmed by an appellate court, <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/09/high-court-bars-lula-candidacy.shtml">rendered him ineligible to run for the presidency</a>, clearing the way for Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate, to win against Lula’s chosen successor, Haddad, the former São Paulo mayor. Supporters of the PT and many others in Brazil have long insisted that these prosecutors, while masquerading as apolitical and non-ideological actors whose only agenda was fighting corruption, were in fact right-wing ideologues whose overriding mission was to destroy the PT and prevent Lula&#8217;s return to power in the 2018 election.</p>\n<p>These documents lend obvious credibility to those accusations. They show extensive plotting in secret to block and undermine the September 28 judicial order from Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski, which authorized one of the country’s most prominent reporters, Folha&#8217;s Mônica Bergamo, to interview Lula in prison. Lewandowski’s decision was expressly grounded in the right of a free press, which he said entitled the newspaper to speak to Lula and report on his perspectives.</p>\n<p>In his decision, Lewandowski also explained that the arguments that had been used all year to prevent a prison interview with Lula — namely, “security fears“ and the need to keep prisoners silent — were blatantly invalid given the numerous other prison interviews “permitted for prisoners condemned of crimes such as trafficking, murder and international organized crime.” The ruling also noted that Lula was neither in a maximum-security prison nor under a specially restrictive prison regime, further eroding the rationale for a ban on interviewing him.</p>\n<p>Up until that point, Lula — widely regarded as one of the most effective and charismatic political communicators in the democratic world — had been held incommunicado, prevented from speaking to the public about the election. Any pre-election interview of Lula, in which he could have offered his views on Bolsonaro and the other candidates, including the PT’s Haddad, would have commanded massive media attention and likely influenced a decisive bloc of voters who, to this day, remain highly loyal to the former president (which is why Lula, even once he was imprisoned, remained the poll frontrunner).</p>\n<p>The Car Wash prosecutors learned of the judicial decision authorizing Folha’s pre-election prison interview with Lula when an article about it was posted in their encrypted Telegram chat group. The panic among them was immediate. They repeatedly worried that the interview, to be conducted so close to the first round of voting, would help the PT’s Haddad win the presidential election. Based explicitly on that fear, the Car Wash prosecutors spent the day working feverishly to develop strategies to either overturn the ruling, delay Lula’s interview until after the election, or ensure that it was structured so as to minimize its political impact and its ability to help the PT win.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the decision, Tessler, one of the prosecutors, exclaimed: “What a joke!!! Revolting!!! There he goes hold a rally in prison. A true circus. After Mônica Bergamo, based on the principle of equal treatment, I’m sure many other journalists will also be coming … and we’re left here, made to act like clowns with a supreme court like that …” Another prosecutor, Athayde Ribeiro Costa, responded to the decision with one word and numerous exclamation marks: “Mafiosos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>\n<p>The prosecutors, according to the time stamps on their chats, spent nearly a full day inventing strategies for how to prevent the Lula interview from taking place before the election or at least dilute its impact — from speculating whether a press conference would be less effective than a one-on-one interview, or whether they should petition to allow all other prisoners to be interviewed to distract attention from Lula. Tessler then made clear why these prosecutors were so deeply upset that the public could be allowed to hear from the former president so soon before the election: “Who knows … but an interview before the second round of voting could help elect Haddad.”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253991" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-632785312-1560054341.jpg" alt="Brazilian Deltan Dallagnol, attorney of the Federal Public Ministry, speaks during an interview in Curitiba, Brazil on January 26, 2017.

To the contrary, the entire discussion, held over many hours, reads far less like a meeting of neutral prosecutors than a war-room session of anti-PT political operatives and strategists, focused on the goal of determining the most effective way to prevent or minimize the political impact of Lula’s interview.</p>\n<p>Athayde Ribeiro Costa, for instance, cynically suggested that the omission of any date in Lewandowski’s decision could allow the Federal Police to purposely schedule the interview for after the election while pretending to comply with the order: “There’s no date. So the Federal Police could just schedule this for after the election, and we’ll still be in compliance with the decision.”</p>\n<p>Another prosecutor, Januário Paludo, proposed a series of actions designed to prevent or minimize the Lula interview: “Plan A: we could enter an appeal on the Supreme Court itself, zero probability [of success]. Plan B: open it up for everybody to interview him on the same day. It’ll be chaotic but reduces the likelihood that the interview is directed.”</p>\n<p>At no point did Dallagnol, who actively participated in the discussion throughout the day, or any other Car Wash prosecutor, suggest that it was improper for such political considerations to drive prosecutorial strategizing. Indeed, this Telegram chat group, which was used by its participants for many months, suggests that political considerations of this kind were routinely incorporated into the task force’s decision-making process.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The prosecutors lamented among themselves that they were barred from appealing the decision because an appeal in the name of the task force would make them look too political and would create the public perception that their intentions were to silence Lula and prevent him from helping the PT win — which, as these documents reveal, was indeed their actual motive. But later in the day, they learned that a right-wing party, called Novo (meaning “New”), had appealed the decision, and that the authorization to interview Lula was stayed by the court. They boisterously celebrated this news by, among other things, mocking the conflicts that were likely to arise within the Supreme Court (STF) and heaping praise on those responsible for trying to stop the interview:</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="section" data-background-color="#f6f6f6" data-nested-content="%3Cbr%20%2F%3E%0A%3Cdiv%20class%3D%27img-wrap%20align-center%20%20width-fixed%27%20style%3D%27width%3A%20px%3B%27%3E%0A%3Cimg%20class%3D%22alignright%20size-thumbnail%20wp-image-253917%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2Fwp-uploads%2Fsites%2F1%2F2019%2F06%2Fst7-1560024676.png%22%20alt%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EJanu%C3%A1rio%20Paludo%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A41%3A02%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20Just%20heard%20about%20it%E2%80%A6%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EDeltan%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A41%3A32%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20lol%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EAthayde%20Costa%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A42%3A02%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20The%20atmosphere%20at%20the%20STF%20must%20be%20great%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EJanu%C3%A1rio%20Paludo%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A42%3A11%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20it%E2%80%99s%20gonna%20be%20a%20war%20of%20judicial%20decisions%E2%80%A6%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cdiv%20class%3D%27img-wrap%20align-center%20%20width-fixed%27%20style%3D%27width%3A%20px%3B%27%3E%0A%3Cimg%20class%3D%22alignright%20size-thumbnail%20wp-image-253919%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2Fwp-uploads%2Fsites%2F1%2F2019%2F06%2Fst8-1560024775.png%22%20alt%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3Cbr%20%2F%3E%0A"></div>\n<p>Paludo added, ironically, that &#8220;we should thank our Prosecutors&#8217; Office: the Novo Party!&#8221; meaning that this right-wing political party, which was also contesting the 2018 election, had performed what the task force themselves wanted to achieve by preventing Lula from being heard.</p>\n<p>The appeal from that party resulted in a judicial stay of Lewandowski&#8217;s interview authorization. As a result, no pre-election interview with Lula was permitted and he was thus never heard from prior to the voting. Only once the election was concluded and Bolsonaro won did the Supreme Court begin authorizing media outlets to interview Lula in prison. Last month, Bergamo of Folha was permitted to interview Lula <a href="https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/04/27/politica/1556391281_348638.html">jointly with El País Brasil</a>, and shortly thereafter, Lewandowski granted The Intercept Brasil’s petition to interview Lula alone, the video and transcript of which <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/22/lula-brazil-ex-president-prison-interview/">were published by The Intercept</a>.</p>\n<p>Once Bolsonaro was elected president, he quickly offered Moro — whose corruption ruling had resulted in Lula’s candidacy being barred — a newly created and unprecedentedly powerful position as what is now called the “super justice minister,” designed to reflect the massive powers vested in Moro.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'> <a href="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/appoints-1560085005.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254067" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/appoints-1560085005-1024x567.png" alt="appoints-1560085005" /></a> </div>\n<p>That the same judge who found Lula guilty was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-sergio-moro-brazil-justice-ministry-anti-corruption">rewarded by Lula’s victorious opponent</a> made even longtime supporters of the Car Wash corruption probe uncomfortable, due to the obvious perception (real or not) of a quid pro quo, and by the transformation of Moro, who long insisted he was apolitical, into a political official working for the most far-right president ever elected in the history of Brazil’s democracy. Those concerns heightened when Bolsonaro <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2019/05/bolsonaro-says-he-will-nominate-sergio-moro-to-the-supreme-court.shtml">recently admitted</a> that he had also promised to appoint Moro to a lifelong seat on the Supreme Court as soon as there was a vacancy.</p>\n<p>Now that the actual conversations and actions of the Car Wash team and of Moro can be revealed and seen, the public — both in Brazil and internationally — will finally have the opportunity to evaluate whether their longtime denials of being politically motivated were ever true.</p>\n<p>These September 28 discussions are just the start of reporting by The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil on this archive.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 9, 2019, 8:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Car Wash task force did not refute the authenticity of the information published by The Intercept.

They reveal serious wrongdoing, unethical behavior, and systematic deceit about which the public, both in Brazil and internationally, has the right to know.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="secret-brazil-archive" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>These three articles were published today in The Intercept Brasil in Portuguese, and we have synthesized them into <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/">two English-language</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">articles for The Intercept</a>. Given the size and global influence of Brazil under the new Bolsonaro government, these stories are of great significance to an international audience.</p>\n<p>This is merely the beginning of what we intend to be an ongoing journalistic investigation, using this massive archive of material, into the Car Wash corruption probe; Moro&#8217;s actions when he was a judge and those of the prosecutor Dallagnol; and the conduct of numerous individuals who continue to wield great political and economic power both inside Brazil and in other countries.</p>\n<p>Beyond the inherent political, economic, and environmental importance of Brazil under Bolsonaro, the significance of these revelations arises from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/brazil-operation-car-wash-is-this-the-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-history">incomparably consequential actions</a> of the yearslong Car Wash corruption probe. That sweeping scandal implicated numerous leading political figures, oligarchs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/americas/brazil-car-wash-corruption-temer.html">Bolsonaro&#8217;s predecessor as president</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-17/former-president-of-peru-shoots-self-in-head-as-police-close-in">even foreign leaders</a> in corruption prosecutions.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, Car Wash was the investigative saga that led to the imprisonment of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva last year. Lula&#8217;s conviction by Moro, once it was quickly affirmed by an appellate court, <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/09/high-court-bars-lula-candidacy.shtml">rendered him ineligible to run for president</a> at a time when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/16/lula-da-silva-is-in-jail-and-hes-still-brazils-leading-candidate-for-president-here-are-3-ways-that-could-turn-out/?utm_term=.b565bbe7a708">all polls showed that Lula</a> — who was twice elected president by large margins in 2002 and in 2006 before being term-limited out of office in 2010 with <a href="http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2010/12/popularidade-de-lula-bate-recorde-e-chega-87-diz-ibope.html">an 87 percent approval rating</a> — was the frontrunner in the 2018 presidential race. Lula&#8217;s exclusion from the election, based on Moro&#8217;s finding of guilt, was a key episode that paved the way for Bolsonaro&#8217;s election victory.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most remarkably, after Bolsonaro won the presidency, he created a new position of unprecedented authority, referred to by Brazilians as &#8220;super justice minister,&#8221; to oversee an agency with consolidated powers over law enforcement, surveillance, and investigation previously interspersed among multiple ministries. Bolsonaro created that position for the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/11/bolsonaro-will-offer-superministry-to-operation-carwash-judge.shtml">benefit of the very judge who found Lula guilty</a>, Sergio Moro, and it is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46063656">the position Moro now occupies</a>. In other words, Moro now wields immense police and surveillance powers in Brazil — courtesy of a president who was elected only after Moro, while he was as judge, rendered Bolsonaro&#8217;s key adversary ineligible to run against him.</p>\n<p>The Car Wash prosecutors and Moro have been highly controversial in Brazil and internationally — heralded by many as anti-corruption heroes and accused by others of being clandestine right-wing ideologues masquerading as apolitical law enforcers. Their critics have insisted that they have abused and exploited their law enforcement powers with the politicized goal of preventing Lula from returning to the presidency and destroying his leftist Workers&#8217; Party, or the PT. Moro and the prosecutors have, with equal vehemence, denied that they have any political allegiances or objectives and have said they are simply trying to cleanse Brazil of corruption.</p>\n<p>But, until now, the Car Wash prosecutors and Moro have carried out their work largely in secret, preventing the public from evaluating the validity of the accusations against them and the truth of their denials. That&#8217;s what makes this new archive so journalistically valuable: For the first time, the public will learn what these judges and prosecutors were saying and doing when they thought nobody was listening.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s articles show, among other things, that the Car Wash prosecutors spoke openly of their desire to prevent the PT from winning the election and took steps to carry out that agenda, and that Moro secretly and unethically collaborated with the Car Wash prosecutors to help design the case against Lula despite serious internal doubts about the evidence supporting the accusations, only for him to then pretend to be its neutral adjudicator.</p>\n<p>The Intercept’s only role in obtaining these materials was to receive them from our source, who contacted us many weeks ago (long before the <a href="https://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/brazil/brazils-justice-ministers-smartphone-hacked-for-six-hours/">recently alleged hacking of Moro&#8217;s telephone</a>) and informed us that they had already obtained the full set of materials and was eager to provide them to journalists.</p>\n<p>Informing the public of matters in the public interest and exposing wrongdoing was our guiding principle in doing this initial reporting on the archive, and it will continue to be our guiding principle as we report further on the large number of materials we have been provided.</p>\n<p>The sheer volume of materials in this archive, as well as the fact that many documents include private conversations among public officials, requires us to make journalistic decisions about which documents should be reported on and published, and which documents should be withheld.</p>\n<p>When making these judgments, we employ the standard used by journalists in democracies around the world: namely, that material revealing wrongdoing or deceit by powerful actors should be reported, but information that is purely private in nature and whose disclosure may infringe upon legitimate privacy interests or other social values should be withheld.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in our reporting on this material, we are guided by the same rationale that led much of Brazilian society — including many journalists, commentators, and activists — to praise the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/release-tapped-phone-calls-lula-rousseff-deepens-brazil-chaos">disclosure in 2016 by Moro and various media outlets of the private telephone calls</a> between Lula and former President Dilma Rousseff, in which the two leaders discussed the possibility of Lula becoming a minister in Dilma’s government. Disclosure of those private calls was crucial in turning public opinion against the PT, helping to lay the groundwork for Dilma&#8217;s 2016 impeachment and Lula&#8217;s 2018 imprisonment. The principle invoked to justify that disclosure was the same one we are adhering to in our reporting on these materials: that a democracy is healthier when significant actions undertaken in secret by powerful figures are revealed to the public.</p>\n<p>But unlike those disclosures by Moro and various media outlets of the private conversations between Lula and Dilma — which included not only matters whose disclosures were in the public interest, but also private communications of Lula that <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/transcript-of-phone-calls-between-former-brazilian-president-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-and-various-political-supporters/article29285890/">had no public relevance</a> and that many argued were released with the intention of personally embarrassing Lula — The Intercept has resolved to withhold any private communications, audio recordings, videos, or other materials relating to Moro, Dallagnol, or any other parties that are purely private in nature and thus unrelated to matters of public interest.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>We have taken measures to secure the archive and all of its component materials outside of Brazil, so that numerous journalists have access to it, ensuring that no authorities in any country will have the ability to prevent reporting based on these materials. We intend to report on and publish stories based on the archive as expeditiously as possible in accordance with our high standards of factual accuracy and journalistic responsibility.</p>\n<p>Consistent with journalistic practice in countries where the press operates under the threat of censorship and prior restraint orders, as has been the situation recently in Bolsonaro-led Brazil, we did not seek comment from the powerful legal officials mentioned in these stories prior to publication because we did not want to give them advance notice of this reporting, and because the documents speak for themselves. We contacted them immediately upon publication and will update the stories with their comments if and when they provide them.</p>\n<p>Given the immense power wielded by these actors, and the secrecy under which they have — until now — been able to operate, transparency is crucial for Brazil and the international community to have a clear understanding of what they have really done. A free press exists to shine a light on what the most powerful figures in society do in the dark.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 9, 2019, 8:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Car Wash task force did not refute the authenticity of the information published by The Intercept. In a press release published Sunday evening, they wrote, “possibly among the illegally copied information are documents and data on ongoing strategies and investigations and on the personal and security routines of task force members and their families.

      title: 'Amid Spike in Migrants Crossing the Mediterranean, Europe Is Still Delaying Rescues',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>As summer weather</u> warms the Mediterranean, the number of boats bearing migrants that are caught in distress has spiked, according to groups involved in running search and rescue operations there. Advocates say that European policies aimed at limiting the number of migrants reaching their shores are in fact making the route more deadly.</p>\n<p>More migrants than usual have been leaving Libya for southern Europe in small crafts in the last month and falling into danger along the way, according to Haidi Sadik of Sea-Watch, a nonprofit that does search and rescue.</p>\n<p>“Our civil reconnaissance aircraft called Moonbird has been flying missions throughout the year, including in May, and has seen a significant increase in the number of boats in distress from the air,” said Sadik.</p>\n<p>“We’ve definitely also seen an increase over the last few weeks,” said Maurice Stierl, who helped found Alarm Phone, an activist collective that runs an emergency hotline for migrants in distress in the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href="https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean?migrant_route%5B%5D=1376&amp;migrant_route%5B%5D=1377&amp;migrant_route%5B%5D=1378">Missing Migrants Project</a>, at least 107 migrants died this May crossing the Mediterranean, up from 60 in April. And though far fewer migrants overall compared to this time last year are making the trip, a greater portion of those who do attempt the crossing are dying.</p>\n<p>In the first six months of 2018, 791 of the 70,531 people who attempted the Mediterranean crossing to Europe — 1.1 percent — died. Since January of this year, 35,122 people have attempted the crossing, and 543 have died — 1.5 percent overall, per the Missing Migrants Project.</p>\n<p>Another factor in the sudden uptick in crossing attempts is the recent increase of violence in Libya, the country through which thousands of migrants fleeing violence and poverty have passed on their way to Europe. Last month, Amnesty International voiced concerns that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/16/libya-conflict-migrants-refugees/">the lives of hundreds</a> of migrants and refugees in detention centers in Libya were under imminent threat as fighting between armed militias in the area drew closer.</p>\n<p>But Sam Turner, Médecins Sans Frontières’ head of mission for Libya, says the increased death rate in the Mediterranean is of particular note. “That’s a really key point in terms of challenging the narrative that the actions taken to prevent people from crossing the central Mediterranean … [are] leading to fewer deaths,” he told The Intercept. About 1 in 13 migrants making the crossing in the central Mediterranean region in the first five months of this year died, says Turner; last year for the same period, the number was 1 in 58.</p>\n<p><u>Meanwhile, according to</u> data compiled by Matteo Villa, a researcher at the think tank Italian Institute for International Political Studies, the number of migrants returned to Libya by the Libyan coast guard or others increased nearly tenfold from April to May, with an estimated 1,224 migrants being returned to the war-torn country in May, compared to 130 the month before. This is the greatest number of people returned to Libya since July 2018.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/03/icc-submission-calls-for-prosecution-of-eu-over-migrant-deaths">On Monday</a>, two human rights lawyers filed a 244-page complaint with the International Criminal Court, or ICC, accusing European Union governments of knowingly sending thousands of migrants to their deaths in implementing their deterrence-based migration policies.</p>\n<p>Omer Shatz, one of the lawyers who co-authored the request for the case to be taken on by the ICC, said that there used to be four major actors in the Mediterranean dealing with migrants crossing in boats: European governments, NGOs, commercial vessels, and the Libyan coast guard.</p>\n<p>Commercial vessels, which once rescued migrants from the water, now avoid doing so to evade being implicated in an increasingly politicized act. “You can guarantee that you will end up in a political standoff without somewhere to disembark these people despite the fact that you have simply engaged in a humanitarian act,” said Turner.</p>\n<p>NGOs, according to the ICC complaint, became critical actors in the Mediterranean after the EU’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/01/europe-keeps-its-rescue-ships-far-from-the-coast-of-libya-where-thousands-of-refugees-have-drowned/">2014 decision</a> to decrease its search and rescue operations. Yet “EU and Italian actors launched a broad political persecution against rescue NGOs, which includes intimidation, defamation, harassment, and formal criminalization,” the complaint reads. As The Intercept has reported, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/20/mediterranean-refugee-rescue-boat-italy-libya/">rescue ships</a> have been seized and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/09/16/migrant-rescue-mediterranean-sea/">volunteers arrested</a>.</p>\n<p>With the support of the EU, last year Libya established a search and rescue region beyond its territorial waters, expanding the bounds of where the country coordinates and executes search and rescue operations. As the EU has scaled down its involvement, the principal actor on these waters has become the Libyan coast guard, said Shatz.</p>\n<p>The Libyan coast guard does save lives every day, says Turner, but they can’t keep up with the number of attempted crossings, and the people they do save are sent back to dangerous and deadly conditions. (Libyan coast guard officers have also been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/25/libya-coast-guard-europe-refugees/">accused of abuse</a> themselves.) “Any rescue conducted by the Libyan coast guard results in a de facto forced return; the same place they were fleeing is the place they’re taken back to,” says Turner.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>According to an <a href="https://alarmphone.org/en/2019/05/21/the-mediterranean-border-mass-abductions-push-backs-people-left-to-die">Alarm Phone report</a> published May 21, European authorities have refrained from assisting certain groups of migrants in distress in an apparent attempt to defer search and rescue responsibility to the Libyan coast guard. “Over the last two months … we had to witness several severe human rights violations at sea, including forms of push-back, refoulement, and non-assistance,” the report reads.</p>\n<p>Alarm Phone’s Stierl added that migrants seem to be changing their tactics of survival in response to the policies. “They only call when they’ve gotten further into European search and rescue zones,” he said.</p>\n<p>Alarm Phone shared an edited portion of a recent entry in its logbook with The Intercept that detailed one such event. On May 29, according to the book, the hotline made contact via satellite phone with a boat carrying about 100 people.</p>\n<p>The Alarm Phone entry for 1:20 a.m. on May 30 reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Talked with the boat again – again we cannot promise when coastguards are coming. He says: “It is so fucking inhumane what they are doing with us. We are here in the sea for more than a day now. They came with airplanes helicopters and everything. They know where we are and they just wait for the Libyans to come tomorrow to pick our corpses. Those who will still be alive will maybe then also go into the water because they want rather to die than to go back to Libya. Why can&#8217;t they let any fisher boat save us and then at least to avoid people to die. They can bring us to whatever shitty prison. But this situation here is so inhumane, you cannot imagine how we suffer.” We tell him that we will stay with them until the end, whatever happens. We promise that we call the coastguards and inform the public to raise pressure. He thanks us for being with them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The group, according to Alarm Phone, were ultimately <a href="https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1134003235335880705">rescued by the Italian navy</a>, which means that they became among the few these days to head for an Italian port. But the rescue took too long, Alarm Phone maintains.</p>\n<p>“The @ItalianNavy vessel P490 had monitored the boat in distress yesterday already &amp; could have rescued them nearly a day ago. This act of #non-assistance risked the lives of 90 people,” <a href="https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1134008227887288325">wrote</a> Alarm Phone on Twitter.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/europe-migrants-mediterranean-rescues/">Amid Spike in Migrants Crossing the Mediterranean, Europe Is Still Delaying Rescues</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Kamala Harris, surrounded</u> by thousands of cheering supporters, kicked off her presidential campaign in Oakland earlier this year, <a href="https://kamalaharris.org/our-america/">declaring</a> that she has always fought “on behalf of survivors of sexual assault, a fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma.”</p>\n<p>Fighting on behalf of victims of sexual abuse, particularly children, has been central to Harris’s political identity for the better part of three decades. Harris specialized in prosecuting sex crimes and child exploitation as a young prosecutor just out of law school. She later touted her record on child sexual abuse cases and prosecuting pedophiles in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH18NlAKLMA"> television advertisements</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-tm-kamala-20190121-story.html">splashy profiles</a>, and on the trail as she campaigned for public office.</p>\n<p>But when it came to taking on the Catholic Church, survivors of clergy sexual abuse say that Harris turned a blind eye, refusing to take action against clergy members accused of sexually abusing children when it meant confronting one of the city’s most powerful political institutions.</p>\n<p>When Harris became San Francisco district attorney in 2004, she took over an office that had been working closely with survivors of sexual abuse to pursue cases against the Catholic Church. The office and the survivors were in the middle of a legal battle to hold predatory priests accountable, and Harris inherited a collection of personnel files involving allegations of sexual abuse by priests and employees of the San Francisco Archdiocese, which oversees church operations in San Francisco, and Marin and San Mateo counties.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>“It went from Terence Hallinan going hundred miles an hour, full speed ahead, after the Catholic Church to Kamala Harris doing absolutely nothing.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>The files had been compiled by investigators working under the direction of Terence Hallinan, the radical district attorney who Harris ousted in a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/07/kamala-harris-san-francisco-district-attorney-crime/">contentious</a> election campaign. Hallinan’s team had prosecuted cases of abuse that had occurred decades earlier and had gathered evidence as part of a probe into widespread clergy sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p>Just six months before Harris took office, a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned a California law that had retroactively eliminated the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution of child molestation cases. That shifted the focus to holding predators among the clergy accountable through civil cases and through a broader effort to bring attention to predators who had been shielded by the church.</p>\n<p>Hallinan believed that the clergy abuse files were a matter of public record; Harris refused to release them to the public.</p>\n<p>In her seven years as district attorney, Harris’s office did not proactively assist in civil cases against clergy sex abuse and ignored requests by activists and survivors to access the cache of investigative files that could have helped them secure justice, according to several victims of clergy sex abuse living in California who spoke to The Intercept.</p>\n<p>“It went from Terence Hallinan going hundred miles an hour, full speed ahead, after the Catholic Church to Kamala Harris doing absolutely nothing and taking it backwards hundred miles an hour,” said Joey Piscitelli, a sexual assault survivor, who a <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/incaco20080821025">jury found</a> had been molested as a student while attending Salesian College Preparatory, a Catholic high school in Richmond, California.</p>\n<p>Piscitelli had met with Hallinan’s office to discuss his case and the ongoing investigation into the church. But, he said, when Harris took over, his access to the office was shut off and his requests for clergy abuse files were ignored. Piscitelli resorted to handing out flyers and picketing outside the district attorney’s office on San Francisco’s McAllister Street.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253799" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_05051304662-levada-protest-1559944927.jpg" alt="From left, Dominic Delucca, Sonia Todd, Terrie Light, Joe Piscitelli, and Wayne Presely, all claiming to be victims of clergy abuse, hold a demonstration against the naming of Archbishop William J.

Let&#8217;s just move on.”</p>\n<p>Terence McAteer, a resident of Nevada City, California, says he was raped as a child by Austin Peter Keegan, an infamous San Francisco priest. McAteer said he sees no value in Harris’s decision to conceal the clergy abuse files, which had been used to indict his abuser but remain secret to this day. “Why not tell the story?” said McAteer. “I have no problem with my file being released. I don’t have any great secrets. It’s already in the newspaper. I think the whole cloak of secrecy with the Catholic Church needs to be exposed.”</p>\n<p>Kevin V. Ryan, the former U.S. Attorney for Northern California who worked with Hallinan’s office on the clergy abuse cases, also agreed that the files should be disclosed. “Credible allegations in my opinion should be released,” said Ryan. &#8220;I think they should be made public and I think it’s necessary not only for accountability but for the healing process to begin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several survivors of clergy abuse said they believed that Harris had declined to release the files in deference to the Catholic Church, which has historically held sway as a major political force in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>“The Roman Catholic Church is very powerful and I think they didn’t want to step on any toes, especially in San Francisco,” said De Lucca, citing the influence of former Archbishop William Levada, who oversaw the archdiocese when Harris was district attorney.</p>\n<p>Harris’s presidential campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Intercept.</p>\n<p>Mike Brown, director of communications at the San Francisco Archdiocese, said that his office has “cooperated with every district attorney and attorney general request for records every time.” Brown said he did not believe that the archdiocese attempted to influence the Harris’s decision not to release the clergy abuse files. He added that it was not his place to comment on her decisions. “What was in Kamala Harris’s head?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don’t think I have any way of knowing that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Catholic Church casts a long shadow over San Francisco politics, despite the city’s national reputation for social liberalism and counterculture. Generations of politicians have relied on the endorsement of the archdiocese, which maintained strong support among Irish, Italian, and Latin American immigrant communities.</p>\n<p>David Talbot, a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle and longtime observer of city politics, said, “The San Francisco Archdiocese certainly — through Kamala’s days as district attorney and through the current day — wields significant influence in the city power structure.”</p>\n<p><u>The national focus</u> on clergy sex abuse came in large part as a reaction to the shocking revelations of the 2002 Boston Globe <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/special-reports/2002/01/06/church-allowed-abuse-priest-for-years/cSHfGkTIrAT25qKGvBuDNM/story.html">series</a> on clergy sex abuse in the Boston-area. The investigation revealed that, under the leadership of Cardinal Bernard Law, the Boston Archdiocese covered up for more than 70 priests accused of sexually assaulting children. Following the Globe’s report, media outlets across the country began investigations and found that local church leadership in various locations similarly failed to inform law enforcement of known pedophiles in the clergy and, in some cases, shifted abusers from parish to parish.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>Hallinan’s pursuit brought forward a wave of victims who said they had been raped or molested by clergy over the years.</blockquote>\n<p>Hallinan, in his role as district attorney, responded to the story by requesting that the San Francisco Archdiocese provide 75 years of personnel files relating to sex abuse cases. &#8220;We want anything they have in their records,&#8221; Hallinan told reporters at the time. &#8220;We will see if there are enforceable cases, and if there are, we will prosecute.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The effort made headlines — and engendered some criticism. The San Francisco Chronicle, for instance, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/amp/Hallinan-s-wild-reach-2851438.php">editorialized</a> that the investigation was merely a “fishing expedition.” Hallinan’s pursuit, though, also brought forward a wave of victims who said they had been raped or molested by clergy over the years. Just months after opening his inquiry, Hallinan used a grand jury to begin issuing indictments.</p>\n<p>The Catholic Church personnel files collected by Hallinan were <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news3/2002_09_20_Derbeken_MoreEx_Salvatore_Billante_4.htm">used to indict</a> Keegan. The internal church records suggest that Keegan may have molested as many as 80 local children over the years.

Patrick J. O&#8217;Shea, another former priest indicted by Hallinan, had faced decades of accusations that he groomed altar boys at various Catholic institutions across San Francisco, including Mission Dolores Basilica. O’Shea was accused of regularly bringing children to a lake house outside the city, where he would ply them with alcohol and molest them.</p>\n<p>De Lucca, one of several men who accused O&#8217;Shea, said the former priest molested him on a trip to the lake house in 1978 when he was 12 years old. Other <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Men-blame-shattered-lives-on-abuse-in-youth-by-2849925.php">victims</a> have said they were molested over 100 times by O’Shea at church facilities in the city and at the lake house.</p>\n<p><u>The wave of</u> criminal indictments meant that the San Francisco Archdiocese, under Levada, was suddenly facing repercussions. It could not have come as a total surprise to Levada, who had his own history of dealing with alleged abuses in the clergy’s ranks.</p>\n<p>Levada had previously served as the archbishop of Portland, a role in which he had briefly removed Joseph Baccellieri, a priest accused of molesting a child, in 1992 — only to restore him two years later. According to the newspaper SF Weekly, Levada<a href="https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/levadas-secret/Content?oid=2158763"> quietly provided</a> payments to three male victims in exchange for their silence and a pledge not to sue the archdiocese. The Portland Archdiocese later became the first Catholic diocese to file for bankruptcy over child sex abuse scandals as it paid out over $50 million to settle hundreds of claims.</p>\n<p>A few years later, in 1995, Levada left Portland to become archbishop of San Francisco. He learned in 1996 that a Marin County priest, Gregory Ingels, had been accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Still, Ingels was allowed to continue working and the matter was not reported to police. Instead, Ingels’s career flourished as the priest became an <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/news/blind-eye-unto-the-holy-see/">adviser</a> to Levada, helping the church leader shape his approach to clergy sex abuse issues. Ingels was later brought up on molestation charges, including molesting two teenagers in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Levada’s star would continue to rise in the church. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI named Levada as the guardian of church doctrine, elevating the archbishop to one of the most powerful posts in the Vatican.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253804" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-52820731-william-levada-1559945345.jpg" alt="SAN FRANCISCO - MAY 13:  San Francisco Archbishop William Levada holds a news conference regarding his recent appointment to the Vatican at St. Francis Hall in St. Mary\'s Cathedral Conference Center on May 13, 2005 in San Francisco, California.

As church officials and former clergy members faced a slew of criminal charges, prosecutors faced a setback when, in June 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-jun-28-me-sexabuse28-story.html">overturned</a> a 1994 California law that had extended the criminal statute of limitations in sex abuse cases — the law under which indictments had been issued against clergy members. Following the Supreme Court’s ruling, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/California-molestation-law-struck-down-Lifting-2606338.php">hundreds</a> of accused abusers across the state <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Accused-abusers-freed-in-Bay-Area-16-including-2577085.php">walked</a> free, including priests and clergy indicted in San Francisco such as O’Shea, Ingels, Keegan, and Billiante. Because the criminal cases came to a halt, the accusations made against these clergy could not be tried, and no finding of guilt was ever made.</p>\n<p>The high-court ruling closed the door on criminal prosecutions over abuse that occurred in the past, but a new avenue remained open for civil cases. As Hallinan’s investigations unfolded in 2002, state Sen. John Burton, who represented San Francisco, authored legislation to waive the statute of limitations in civil cases, allowing victims of childhood sexual abuse a chance to seek justice in court with a one-year window to file suit.</p>\n<p>The church, then under the leadership of Levada, the archbishop, characterized the effort to extend the statute of limitations as a plot to line the pockets of trial lawyers. The archdiocese newspaper, Catholic San Francisco, <a href="https://issuu.com/productioncsf/docs/csf-12-06-02">responded</a> to Burton’s law with an article warning of a &#8220;swarm of lawsuits&#8221; as &#8220;lawyers aggressively seek sex abuse business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But the law was quickly passed. In 2003, hundreds of survivors including Piscitelli filed civil lawsuits against their alleged abusers, under the condition that they could show that the employers of abusers had known of allegations of misconduct and failed to act.</p>\n<p><u>As the drama</u> of the church sex abuse cases was unfolding in 2003, Kamala Harris waged a bitter campaign to win the district attorney’s office, alleging that Hallinan had been “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/07/kamala-harris-san-francisco-district-attorney-crime/">soft on crime</a>.” Much of the old guard of San Francisco&#8217;s political establishment, which had grown wary of Hallinan&#8217;s pugnacious style and investigations of political leaders and police misconduct, backed Harris. The election went to runoff, which Harris handily won.</p>\n<p>As the dust settled over the election campaign, hundreds of survivors were shifting their focus to civil court, hoping that they could take advantage of Burton’s law to hold the Catholic Church responsible for shielding predators.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>“We were told office policy was we can’t provide you with anything.”</blockquote>\n<p>Because Piscitelli, De Lucca, and other survivors had spoken with Hallinan’s investigators, they were surprised when the new district attorney’s office appeared to shift course and declined to meet with them. “My jaw just dropped,” said De Lucca, who was by then working with the activist group Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. “SNAP was very upset about it.”</p>\n<p>About a year after Harris took office, Piscitelli, whose <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/12enqmrvk/superior-court-of-california-county-of-contra-costa/piscitelli-v-salesians-of-st-john-bosco/">lawsuit</a> was already underway, wrote Harris to ask for assistance in his case against the Salesians of Don Bosco, the church institution that oversaw the school where he was abused. In the letter, which he shared with The Intercept, Piscitelli noted that his alleged abuser, Steven Whelan, was working at the Saints Peter and Paul Church in San Francisco, a position that placed him in an environment filled with children.</p>\n<p>“I know you have files on clergy sex abusers in San Francisco, and you may have a file on him. Please send me that file,” wrote Piscitelli. “Several San Francisco Salesians, and other priests are being sued for sex abuse now, and you may be able to help their victims, and protect other kids from being new victims.”</p>\n<p>When no response came, Piscitelli, who had become a volunteer activist with SNAP, began posting flyers and picketed the offices of the district attorney, accusing her of cozy ties with Levada, then the top Catholic official in the city.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253816" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/piscitelli-yearbook-1559946342.jpg" alt="piscitelli-yearbook-1559946342" /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">A Salesian College Preparatory yearbook photo of Joey Piscitelli from the summer after he was in 8th grade.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Courtesy of Joey Piscitelli</p></div>\n<p>Without any help from Harris, Piscitelli continued to pursue his case. During the trial, which took place in Contra Costa County in 2006, Piscitelli testified that when he was 14, Whelan, a teacher and vice principal at Salesian High School in Richmond, had masturbated in front of him while another priest, “Sal” Billante, had watched and expressed pleasure. The jury found that from 1969 through 1971, Whelan continued to molest and rape Piscitelli and told him that no one would believe him if he spoke out.</p>\n<p>The trial made headlines as the church sought to discredit Piscitelli, but he won his case. In 2006, a jury awarded him $600,000 in damages. The Salesian order appealed the verdict, but an appellate court sided with Piscitelli.</p>\n<p>By the time the judgment came down, Piscitelli had become a coordinator with SNAP and was continuing with his activism to highlight sexual abuse in the church. He picketed the church in San Francisco where Whelan had transferred and asked Harris to take action against other abusers he said were being sheltered by the church. Harris had under her control a tremendous cache of records related to abuse at the church, and even if criminal prosecution was no longer an option, Piscitelli felt that releasing them would ensure some measure of justice.</p>\n<p>“It is not understandable that you have refused to release the documents that have been previously collected by DA Terence Hallinan, that spell out the names of the child rapists, and molesters who have wreaked havoc on children here,” Piscitelli wrote in a second letter to Harris in 2010, requesting the church personnel files.</p>\n<p>Rick Simons, Piscitelli&#8217;s attorney, had served as a plaintiff’s liaison on the Clergy III <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/OAKLAND-Judge-says-Catholic-Church-may-have-2693630.php">consolidated</a> lawsuit of over 100 similar cases. He said that he had received informal assistance from a number of district attorneys in the region, including Alameda County&#8217;s Nancy O&#8217;Malley, who had worked closely with victims and plaintiffs’ attorneys to suggest records to subpoena.</p>\n<p>But Harris had stonewalled. Simons recalled phone conversations with Harris’s office in which no help was offered. He said, “We were told office policy was we can’t provide you with anything.”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253813" src="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_04010804101-1559945994-1024x761.jpg" alt="San Francisco\'s new district attorney, Kamala Harris, right, receives the oath of office from California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald M.

In both cases, her office refused. The newspaper revealed that shortly after being elected, Harris had <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_01_06/2005_01_19_Russell_SFArchbishop.htm">worked</a> with church officials and other prosecutors to conceal the clergy records, electing to only divulge clergy abuse files over the course of a criminal investigation, a possibility forestalled by the Supreme Court ruling.</p>\n<p>Several California prosecutors signed a controversial protocol at the time with the Catholic Church to conceal similar sexual abuse documents. SF Weekly <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_01_06/2005_01_19_Russell_SFArchbishop.htm">reported</a> that the “protocol basically puts church officials on the honor system for turning over materials that they determine may be of relevance to the district attorney.”</p>\n<p>Hallinan expressed outrage at the agreement and supported the effort to release the files. He told the magazine that he &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t do a deal like that for [the archdiocese] any more than I would if it were an Elks Club with a bunch of pedophiles. Those are the kinds of deals that have allowed the church sex scandal to go on as long as it has.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div class=\'img-wrap align-right  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 812px;\'>\n<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-253811" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_05080707156-protest-1559945842-812x1024.jpg" alt="Protestors stand in front of St. Mary\'s Cathedral while Archbisop William Lavada of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco gives his final mass in San Francisco, Sunday August 7, 2005.

In a follow-up story, SF Weekly confirmed that Harris had the power to release the clergy sex abuse files as public record but had again refused.</p>\n<p>“District Attorney Harris focuses her efforts on putting child molesters in prison,” Harris’s office responded in a statement to the paper. “We&#8217;re not interested in selling out our victims to look good in the paper. When this case was brought under Terence Hallinan, prosecutors took the utmost care to protect the identity and dignity of the victims. That was the right thing to do then and it&#8217;s the right thing to do now.”</p>\n<p>The response baffled victims’ advocates and Hallinan, who reiterated his support for releasing the files. “It was just a flat-out insult,” said Piscitelli. “She could have redacted the names, blacked out the names and left them out.”</p>\n<p>Joelle Casteix, founder of Survivors Taking on Predators, a national advocacy group for victims of clergy sexual abuse, said she was disappointed with the Harris statement. “Sunlight is the greatest disinfectant,” said Casteix. “Victims come forward because they are afraid that the person who hurt them is still out there, hurting other kids, or someone from the diocese is still lying about it. I haven’t met a single survivor who’s said, ‘Boy, am I glad they kept the documents for my case secret.’”</p>\n<p>Elliot Beckelman, a former prosecutor in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office who initially oversaw the clergy abuse files and handled the criminal investigation of clergy abuse, said he did not recall that the attorneys for survivors requested the documents. He did remember opposing the effort to release the documents to the press. “The only thing I remember is the SF Weekly asking,” said Beckelman.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>“It was just a flat-out insult. She could have redacted the names, blacked out the names and left them out.”</blockquote>\n<p>Still, he said, he believes that Harris made the right choice in declining to release the documents. “I don’t think a district attorney should float that out there if a person can’t defend themselves,” Beckelman continued. “It’s a very serious charge, a sex crime.”</p>\n<p>“The Catholics, like other minorities, feel picked upon, and I thought for the integrity of the investigation that we don’t have running press conferences to make out that the Catholics are worse than the Jews — which I am — or worse than the Hindus,” Beckelman said. “There’s always a balance that comes to sexual assault investigations.”</p>\n<p>Others in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, however, recall getting requests for files from victims. &#8220;I certainly remember receiving phone calls from attorneys representing victims and I can’t remember what we actually did,&#8221; said Erin Gallagher, a former investigator who worked with Beckelman on the clergy abuse cases at the district attorney&#8217;s office. &#8220;I don’t recall letters requesting documents, but as I said, but I do remember having a number of phone conversations. I don’t remember how those played out.”</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The decision to conceal the San Francisco Archdiocese clergy abuse files stands in stark contrast to recent investigations into Catholic sex abuse across the country.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, prosecutors have reopened wide-ranging investigations into systemic clergy sex abuse. Attorneys general in Iowa, New Mexico, Michigan, Illinois, and other states have asked the Catholic Church to produce internal files of clergy accused of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>Last August, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro released a <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/report/">900-page report</a> from a Pittsburgh grand jury listing 300 priests credibly accused of sexual misconduct. The report included internal church personnel documents, redacting the names of the victims, detailing dozens of cases of confidential letters making clear that incidents of clergy rape, molestation, and other forms of child sex abuse had been reported to high-level church officials. In case after case, church officials were made aware of misconduct and responded by moving the accused priests to parishes around Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>McAteer, one of the survivors who spoke to The Intercept, said his abuser had continued to rape children well after he had reported the incident. “I went to the church in ’77, wrote the archbishop, met with the archbishop, told him the story of what happened when I was raped by Father Keegan,” said McAteer. The church, he said, “covered it up” and allowed his abuser to continue raping children. With the church failing to report the abuse to authorities, Keegan was moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he was <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/9145874-181/catholic-churchs-santa-rosa-diocese">accused</a> of raping or molesting at least 50 other children.</p>\n<p>“I think the whole problem with this Catholic Church scandal is very rarely has anyone come clean. Finally, we saw in Pittsburgh — finally they said, ‘Let’s tell it like it is,’” McAteer said. “I know the San Francisco files are egregious as well. Why not tell the story so the Catholic Church can clean its act up?”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253809" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/Piscitelli-1559945533.jpg" alt="Piscitelli-1559945533" /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">Joey Piscitelli at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Leighton Woodhouse for The Intercept</p></div>\n<p>Piscitelli supports the Pennsylvania probe, as well as the other investigations of Catholic Church sex abuse in other states.</p>\n<p>Last year, Piscitelli wrote a letter to current California Attorney General Xavier Becerra demanding that Becerra open an inquiry into clergy sexual abuse. Within weeks, Piscitelli received a response and a request to meet with state investigators. Becerra soon set up a tip line for other survivors to come forward and has demanded clergy abuse records from all 12 Catholic Church dioceses in California.</p>\n<p>While previous prosecutions of clergy sex abuse have focused on individual priests or employees of the church, some are hoping the latest round investigations will lead to a more systemic look at the scandal. Kevin Ryan, the former federal prosecutor who worked closely with Hallinan&#8217;s office, said prosecutors could pursue charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a statute used to prosecute organized crime.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are still civil RICO potential charges, potential criminal RICO charges if there is a cover-up and it is ongoing,&#8221; said Ryan. &#8220;We need to know, we need accountability, and certainly we need to be prosecuting the cases we can and anyone involved in this activity should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The San Francisco Archdiocese has <a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/tns-catholic-sex-abuse-audit.html">told</a> reporters that it is in discussions with an outside organization to review 4,000 personnel files over clergy abuse allegations, but has so far declined to release a list of priests accused of sexual abuse. Mike Brown, the spokesperson for the archdiocese, told The Intercept that he expects a list of names to be released over the summer this year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/kamala-harris-san-francisco-catholic-church-child-abuse/">As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala Harris&#8217;s Office Stopped Cooperating With Victims of Catholic Church Child Abuse</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>In 2018, President</u> Donald Trump was seeking to jettison the landmark nuclear deal that his predecessor had signed with Iran in 2015, and he was looking for ways to win over a skeptical press. The White House claimed that the nuclear deal had allowed Iran to increase its military budget, and Washington Post reporters Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/05/09/fact-checking-president-trumps-reasons-for-leaving-the-iran-nuclear-deal/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5f4c2b7f622f">asked for a source</a>. In response, the White House passed along an article published in Forbes by a writer named Heshmat Alavi.</p>\n<p>“Iran’s current budget is funded largely through ‘oil, taxes, increasing bonds, [and] eliminating cash handouts or subsidies’ for Iranians, according to an article by a Forbes contributor, Heshmat Alavi, sent to us by a White House official,” Rizzo and Kelly reported. The White House had used Alavi’s article — itself partly drawn from Iranian sources — to justify its decision to terminate the agreement.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>“Heshmat Alavi is a persona run by a team of people from the political wing of the MEK. This is not and has never been a real person.”</blockquote>\n<p>There’s a problem, though: Heshmat Alavi appears not to exist. Alavi’s persona is a propaganda operation run by the Iranian opposition group Mojahedin-e-Khalq, which is known by the initials MEK, two sources told The Intercept.</p>\n<p>“Heshmat Alavi is a persona run by a team of people from the political wing of the MEK,” said Hassan Heyrani, a high-ranking defector from the MEK who said he had direct knowledge of the operation. “They write whatever they are directed by their commanders and use this name to place articles in the press. This is not and has never been a real person.”</p>\n<p>Heyrani said the fake persona has been managed by a team of MEK operatives in Albania, where the group has one of its bases, and is used to spread its message online. Heyrani’s account is echoed by Sara Zahiri, a Farsi-language researcher who focuses on the MEK. Zahiri, who has sources among Iranian government cybersecurity officials, said that Alavi is known inside Iran to be a “group account” run by a team of MEK members and that Alavi himself does not exist.</p>\n<p>Alavi, whose contributor biography on the Forbes website identifies him as “an Iranian activist with a passion for equal rights,” has published scores of articles on Iran over the past few years at Forbes, The Hill, the Daily Caller, The Federalist, Saudi-owned al-Arabiya English, and other outlets. (Alavi did not respond to The Intercept’s requests for comment by Twitter direct messages or at the Gmail address he used to correspond with news outlets.)</p>\n<p>The articles published under Alavi’s name, as well as his social media presence, appear to have been a boon for the MEK. An opposition group deeply unpopular in Iran and known for its sophisticated propaganda, the MEK has over the past decade turned its attention to English-language audiences — especially in countries like the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom, whose foreign policies are crucial nodes in the MEK’s central goal of overthrowing the Iranian regime.</p>\n<p><u>Alavi’s persona is</u> said to be managed by a trio of MEK members. Heyrani, who at one time helped coordinate online operations for the group, named the individuals and a commander from MEK’s political wing who have been responsible for writing English-language articles and tweets under Heshmat Alavi’s name, and shared their photographs and names with The Intercept. “They were my friends. We were close friends,” Heyrani said. “We were working together.”</p>\n<p><div class=\'img-wrap align-right  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 768px;\'>\n<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-253771" src="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/hassan-heyrani-1559938265-768x1024.jpg" alt="hassan-heyrani-1559938265" /></p>\n<p class="caption">Hassan Heyrani.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo: Courtesy of Hassan Heyrani</p></div>Heyrani explained that the MEK leadership would not look kindly on the fluent English speakers who operate the persona writing under their own names. Rank-and-file members, he said, are discouraged from having prominent public profiles — a reflection of what many critics have said is the MEK’s cult-like operating principles. “The leader of the organization doesn’t allow any person to use their real name,” said Heyrani, “because the leader is the first man in the organization, and everything should be under their shadow.”</p>\n<p>The MEK conducts relentless online information campaigns, using an army of bots to flood online debates about Iran with the group’s perspective. One of the goals of the MEK team that manages the Hesmat Alavi account, Heyrani said, is to get articles under Alavi’s name published in the American press. The Intercept’s requests for comment to the MEK’s political wing, along with interview requests to the alleged operators of Alavi’s persona, went unanswered.</p>\n<p>Another former MEK member now living in Canada, Reza Sadeghi, confirmed that the trio identified by Heyrani was involved with the group’s online information operations. Sadeghi was a member of the MEK until 2008, involved in lobbying activities in the United States, as well as operations at the MEK’s former base at Camp Ashraf in Iraq. He described a growing online propaganda center run by the group, intended to sway online discourse about Iran.</p>\n<p>“We were always active in making false news stories to spread to the foreign press and in Iran,” Sadeghi said. “At Camp Ashraf, there were computers set up to do online information operations. Over the years, this activity got more intense with the introduction of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>“We were always active in making false news stories to spread to the foreign press and in Iran. At Camp Ashraf, there were computers set up to do online information operations.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>The MEK is among the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/02/26/long-march-yellow/">most controversial groups</a> seeking to depose the Iranian government. Although today it is mainly involved in political activism and lobbying, the group also has a history of violence. From 1997 until 2012, the MEK was listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department, a status that was finally revoked as part of a diplomatic deal struck by the Obama administration. The group’s last <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG871.pdf">claimed</a> violent attack was in 2001.</p>\n<p>The MEK initially sided with the Islamic Revolution but fell out of favor shortly after the establishment of the clerical-led Islamic Republic. The subsequent crackdown forced the group into exile, operating between France and Iraq — where, thanks to Saddam Hussein’s largesse, the group occupied Camp Ashraf, used as a staging ground for its participation on Iraq’s side of the brutal Iran-Iraq War.</p>\n<p>The years following the U.S.’s invasion of Iraq were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/02/26/long-march-yellow/">harrowing for the MEK</a>, complicated by the terrorist listing. As the Americans withdrew their military forces, they handed over security at the MEK’s Iraqi base to the Iraqi government; another round of violent crackdowns ensued. The 2012 deal to remove the MEK from the U.S. terror list facilitated the movement of thousands of MEK members from Iraq to Albania, where the group would be housed in a new secretive compound. It is from this base in Albania where, according to the MEK defector Heyrani, some of the MEK members managing the Alavi persona were said to be working.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253776" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/alavi-forbes-1559938930-1024x741.jpg" alt="alavi-forbes-1559938930" /></p>\n<p class="caption">Alavi&#8217;s author page for Forbes.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Screenshot: The Intercept</p></div>\n<p><u>Alavi’s articles tend</u> to mix scathing denunciations of the Iranian government with not-so-subtle <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2018/03/21/trump-iran-mek-albania-nowruz/#52789f472adf">suggestions</a> that it might be replaced by the MEK and its leader, Maryam Rajavi. The group seems to have had great success with Alavi, particularly at Forbes.</p>\n<p>The Intercept reached out to editors at the outlets that Alavi has published articles with over the past several years. None of these outlets were able to confirm that they ever spoke with or met Alavi. He was not paid for his writing at Forbes, the Daily Caller, or the Diplomat, according to spokespeople for those publications.</p>\n<p>Although Alavi has published articles about Iran in a number of predominantly right-leaning publications, by far the most frequent publisher of his articles is Forbes. In a span of a year, between April 2017 and April 2018, Alavi published a staggering 61 articles for the Forbes website.</p>\n<p>A Twitter account created under Alavi’s name in 2014 boasts over 30,000 followers, including a number of journalists and D.C.-based conservative think tank employees. The account <a href="https://twitter.com/HeshmatAlavi/status/1096523048654651392">frequently</a> shares articles and hashtags praising Rajavi and shares footage of protests and events held by the MEK.</p>\n<p>Alavi seems to have gained some purchase in right-wing circles in Washington. In addition to his many articles published by Forbes and other sites, Alavi also appears to run a blog called “<a href="https://irancommentary.wordpress.com/">Iran Commentary</a>,” which describes its mission as focusing on “issues related to Iran and the Middle East.” One of its reports was recently <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/report-senior-irgc-commander-flees-iran-with-secret-intel/">cited</a> as a source in an article from the Washington Free Beacon, a neoconservative site that takes an ultra-hawkish view on Iran.</p>\n<p>The body of work published under Alavi’s name takes a consistently hawkish line toward the Iranian government and President Hassan Rouhani. Alavi’s articles also mixed criticisms of Iran and U.S. policy with overt advocacy for the MEK. His pieces in the Daily Caller, The Hill, and other outlets — though less numerous than his contributions to Forbes — employed a similar mix of advocacy against the Iranian regime and praise for the MEK. Though the MEK is known to be widely loathed among Iranians, Alavi described the group as the “main Iranian opposition group” in a 2017 <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2017/02/03/language-iran-understands-loud-and-clear/">Daily Caller</a> article.</p>\n<p>The Diplomat, a foreign policy website that published a handful of Alavi’s pieces in 2017, said that Alavi sent drafts from a Gmail account. Alavi pitched the outlet dozens of articles, though only a small number were accepted. The Diplomat stopped accepting pitches from Alavi after determining that his articles were not meeting publication standards, said a source who asked for anonymity to discuss internal matters.</p>\n<p>The Daily Caller also told The Intercept that the outlet stopped publishing Alavi’s articles over concerns about the quality of his submissions. The Hill, al-Arabiya English, and The Federalist did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>“We terminated our relationship with Heshmat Alvi in early 2018,&#8221; a Forbes spokesperson said in a statement to The Intercept. &#8220;For your background, all contributors to Forbes.com sign a contract requiring them to disclose any potential conflicts of interest.

The group has paid prominent political figures to give speeches and press conferences, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/02/26/long-march-yellow/">donated money to politicians</a>, and disseminated its messages through these interlocutors’ appearances in media, as well as its own robust social media presence. In 2018, its social media operations were the subject of an Al Jazeera “Listening Post” <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2018/09/faking-online-debate-iran-180915121527882.html">documentary</a>.</p>\n<p>The group has used these public relations efforts to pursue its policy goals. Up until 2012, the MEK was mostly focused on <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/02/26/long-march-yellow/">getting itself off the U.S. terror list</a>. In the years that followed, the group focused on attacking nuclear diplomacy between Iran and the U.S., and, after 2015, attacking the deal itself. Throughout, the MEK’s messaging has emphasized regime change — and attempted to present the MEK as a viable alternative to the Islamic Republic’s leadership, offering Rajavi, who has been the group’s public face for a decade and a half, as a potential figure to lead the country.</p>\n<p>Alavi’s articles often track closely with these objectives. In his stories, Alavi has included positive references to Rajavi, as well as the MEK’s political wing, the National Council of Resistance of Iran. In an article in Forbes effectively calling for international support for regime change in Iran, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2018/02/01/irans-future-in-its-own-words/#26644d841c17">Alavi wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The time has come to set aside the “reformist” mirage in Iran. For decades, Maryam Rajavi, as President of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, is providing the sole, realistic alternative for Iran with a ten-point plan that enjoys the support of thousands of elected officials across the globe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like his focus on the MEK’s goal of elevating Rajavi, Alavi’s messaging has also lined up with the group’s efforts to attack the Iran nuclear deal. During the period between 2017 and 2018, when Alavi’s articles appeared in Forbes, the Trump administration was taking steps to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/09/10/iran-deal-donald-trump-nikki-haley-nuclear/">extricate</a> the U.S. from the deal, despite <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/13/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-eu-european-union/">objections</a> from European allies and former Obama administration officials. Alavi’s articles egged the administration on, with items such as “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2017/10/06/iran-trump-nuclear-deal-jcpoa/">Iran Feeling The Heat From Trump On Nuclear Deal</a>” and “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2017/08/24/how-trump-can-correctly-approach-irans-nuclear-deal/#15ef6d217505">How Trump Can Correctly Approach Iran&#8217;s Nuclear Deal</a>.” In May 2018, Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the agreement — one month after Alavi’s last article was published in Forbes.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>The MEK’s messaging emphasizes regime change — and Alavi’s articles often track closely with this objective.</blockquote>\n<p>The Alavi <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/2018/03/01/a-close-look-at-irans-budget/#20cbef616e1e">article</a> that the White House offered to the Washington Post in 2018 to justify withdrawing from the nuclear deal cited semiofficial Iranian government sources to demonstrate increased military spending by Rouhani government. It concluded with a rhetorical flourish typical of Alavi’s articles, praising the Trump administration for ending “appeasement” policies toward Iran and chastising Europe for “standing alongside the murderous mullahs’ regime against the will of the Iranian people.”</p>\n<p><u>Alavi’s tack — exerting</u> pressure on political discourse in the United States, rather than in Iran itself — appears to be part of the MEK’s strategy.</p>\n<p>“The group barely produces content in Farsi. They seem to have given up on having a domestic audience in Iran. Their point now is to influence people in the English-speaking world,” said Massoud Khodabandeh, a former member of the MEK’s intelligence department who left the group in 1996. “Their online strategy works in Washington; it doesn’t work in Tehran.”</p>\n<p>Alongside its social media strategy and periodic articles, the MEK involves itself in higher-stakes information campaigns. In 2002, the MEK helped reveal the existence of a covert Iranian nuclear facility near the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/1441113/Irans-nuclear-history.html">city of Natanz</a>. But according to arms control experts, the MEK got crucial details wrong. A 2006 article in the New Yorker also <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/03/06/exiles-6">suggested</a> that the intelligence may have been handed to the group by Israeli intelligence, calling into question the MEK’s claims that it operates a potent espionage network inside Iran.</p>\n<p>In other instances, the MEK’s information has been less than reliable, causing skepticism among many Western national security analysts. During a 2015 press conference, MEK officials <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/exile-group-accuses-iran-of-secret-nuclear-weapons-research/2015/02/24/ad8d64d6-bc5a-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2498b0b617c4">claimed</a> to have evidence of a secret nuclear facility under construction in Iran, complete with clandestine photographs of the site. This claim was partly debunked by a blogger from the liberal website Daily Kos. A reverse image search of a picture of the purported door to the nuclear site <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/02/25/1366697/-BREAKING-Amateur-hour-at-the-Pro-war-media-Latest-allegations-against-Iran-FABRICATED">revealed</a> that it had actually been taken from a commercial website in Iran that advertised safe boxes.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The MEK has had the most success influencing the debate over Iran policy online through its aggressive social media presence. Any remarks about the group or even Iranian politics in general can be expected to be met by scores of MEK-supporters commenting through replies on Twitter and other social media. Many of the pro-MEK accounts will repeat the same messages, often word for word, swarming the mentions of any commentator.</p>\n<p>Geoff Golberg, an expert on social media manipulation and founder of SocialCartograph, a social media mapping firm, took particular note of Alavi’s Twitter account, which appears to act as a node in an online campaign to boost the MEK’s profile. The account is heavily promoted by other pro-MEK accounts, as well as supporters of the group’s policy of confrontation toward Iran. To casual observers, these swarms of online activity can make it seem as though a large number of Iranians are enthusiastic about whatever it is that the MEK is promoting.</p>\n<p>“The Heshmat Alavi account is part of a group of accounts, which, for years, have engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior,” said Golberg. “The account is connected to thousands of inauthentic MEK-focused accounts, many of which regularly engage with the account’s tweets. The goal of these efforts is to create the illusion of a larger support base than exists in reality.”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253777" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/alavi-twitter-1559938932-1024x741.jpg" alt="alavi-twitter-1559938932" /></p>\n<p class="caption">Alavi&#8217;s Twitter account.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Screenshot: The Intercept</p></div>\n<p><u>Alavi has left</u> few traces online — aside from his social media, his articles, and his emails to editors. One single photo, a heavily filtered side profile, is used for all of Alavi’s author profiles, his LinkedIn page, and Twitter account. The photo’s origins are unclear.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, there are strong indications that the Alavi persona is not what it claims to be. The use of fake identities to conduct political propaganda has become common in recent years. The 2016 U.S. presidential election saw the use of innumerable bots and fake accounts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/19/16504510/ten-gop-twitter-russia">spread misinformation</a> and paranoia among the public.</p>\n<p>A 2018 BBC News <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-43745629">investigation</a> looked into another prominent online persona alleged to be false: a Twitter account operating under the name “Sarah Abdallah” that was mixed up heavily in the online debate over the war in Syria. The Sarah Abdallah account was in some ways on the opposite side of the political spectrum as Alavi: Abdallah was a vocal supporter of the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, a close Iranian ally. An online research firm determined Abdallah’s account to be “one of the most influential social media accounts in the online conversation about Syria.”</p>\n<p>Although the BBC investigation raised serious concerns about the influence of a shadowy online account that was being followed by hundreds of real journalists, it stopped short of concluding that Abdallah was fake or being operated by a front organization.</p>\n<p>For all her influence, however, Sarah Abdallah was never able to achieve the success of Heshmat Alavi, whose articles were published in U.S. media outlets and read in the White House.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>“The Mojahedin wants to show to the world that their narrative has support, even from people who are not directly members of the group.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>To those unfamiliar with the internal politics of Iran, Alavi could come across in his writings as what he simply claimed to be: “an Iranian activist with a passion for equal rights.” The former MEK member Heyrani says that this framing is exactly what the group was hoping to create with the persona. To the extent that publications like Forbes were indifferent or amenable to Alavi’s message, it seems to have worked.</p>\n<p>“The Mojahedin” — the Iranian name for the MEK — “wants to show to the world that their narrative has support, even from people who are not directly members of the group,” Heyrani said. “They want to show that other independent people — writers and activists — support their approach and believe that freedom and democracy will come to Iran through the work of this group.”</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 11, 2019</strong><br />\n<em>Several hours after the publication of this article, the Heshmat Alavi account was suspended by Twitter. Shortly thereafter, an account bearing Alavi&#8217;s name on QuodVerum, an alternative social media site, published a <a href="https://social.quodverum.com/@HeshmatAlavi/102242736155575145">post</a> that said The Intercept&#8217;s &#8220;article raises many lies against me &amp; was heavily promoted by pro-Iran regime accounts on Twitter. I was not given a chance to reply.&#8221; (In the weeks and months before publication, The Intercept sent several requests for comment to the Gmail address Alavi used to communicate with various editors at news outlets, and also sent direct messages to the Alavi account on Twitter.) In the QuodVerum post, the Alavi account asked Twitter users to use Twitter to advocate for an end to his suspension from the platform.</em></p>\n<p><em>In a subsequent <a href="https://irancommentary.wordpress.com/2019/06/09/my-twitter-account-has-been-suspended/">post</a> on his blog, Iran Commentary, a user claiming to be Alavi again asked readers to use Twitter to push for his suspension to end. The author went on to concede that Alavi is not the user&#8217;s real name, nor do the profile photos employed by Alavi&#8217;s accounts belong to the user: &#8220;Firstly: No, I will never reveal my real identity or photograph. Not as long as the mullahs’ regime is in power. No activist in his/her right mind would do so. That would place all of my family, friends and myself, both inside &amp; outside of Iran, in complete danger.&#8221; The author continued, &#8220;Secondly: I will not reply to any emails or messages of any kind from The Intercept because their intentions are obvious as a biased, left-wing outlet. They don’t deserve my reply.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>In the Iran Commentary post, Alavi explained his advocacy for the MEK: &#8220;Why do I support the MEK? 1) They have an organization. 2) They have an agenda. 3) They are serious and dedicated.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>Separately, the Forbes author page for Alavi appears to have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heshmatalavi/#82d337a371b0">taken offline</a> and The Diplomat, citing The Intercept&#8217;s investigation, <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/in-lead-up-to-iranian-elections-the-nuclear-deal-becomes-a-heated-topic-of-debate/">retracted</a> the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/iran-nuclear-deal-dilemmas-fueling-elections-standoff/">five</a> <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/what-does-the-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-want-o">articles</a> <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/iranian-regimes-concerns-persist-ahead-of-may-elections/">Alavi</a> <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/04/irans-2017-election-ahmadinejads-candidacy-signals-the-regimes-weakening/">authored</a> on the site, appending an editor&#8217;s note to the stories. &#8220;A June 2019 investigation revealed that this article was authored by a false persona,&#8221; said the editor&#8217;s note. &#8220;Accordingly, this article has been retracted in full for not meeting our standards on authorship disclosure.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>In late May,</u> Guatemala’s interior minister held a press conference to announce that he was reviewing the public’s right to access the country’s Historical Archive of the National Police, citing security concerns and suggesting that it was time for his agency, which oversees the country’s security forces, to take the archive back from the Ministry of Culture. This is no featureless bureaucratic debate. At stake are <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//guatemala/police/harpers.pdf">literally miles of paper files</a> — nearly five miles, in fact — related to Guatemala’s brutal internal armed conflict, which contain clues to the whereabouts of people who were forcibly disappeared decades ago.</p>\n<p>The archive’s employees and supporters have been in crisis mode since its director, Gustavo Meoño Brenner, was dismissed last August; there have been major cuts to its budget and staff. To learn more about the threat to this unique library in the history of human rights, I spoke with Kate Doyle, senior analyst at the National Security Archive in Washington, D.C., who has been involved with the archive since its discovery in 2005. She has served on the archive’s advisory board and assisted in human rights investigations that turned into criminal trials. She sees the attack on the archive as part of “an aggressive rejection of human rights principles” on the part of Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, a rejection that is also evident in other countries across the region.</p>\n<p><div class=\'img-wrap align-right  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 540px;\'>\n<img class="alignright size-article-medium wp-image-253834" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/kate-doyle-1559950375.jpg" alt="kate-doyle-1559950375" /></p>\n<p class="caption">Kate Doyle.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo: Courtesy of Kate Doyle</p></div>“Somehow in this part of the world, we&#8217;ve come to this point of turning our backs on human rights justice and the rule of law in ways that are terribly troubling,” Doyle said. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p><b>What exactly is the Historical Archive of the National Police, and what kind of documents does it contain?</b></p>\n<p>The archive is a repository for the entire historical record of the National Police of Guatemala, an institution that was founded in the 19th century as the country’s first national security force, and abolished and dismantled in 1997 by order of the peace accords that were signed in 1996 to end Guatemala’s 36-year armed conflict.</p>\n<p>This historical archive is not just their origin records from the 1890s. It goes right through those terrible years following the U.S.-funded and supported coup in 1954, which destroyed the democratic government that Guatemala had then, through the military dictatorship in the 1960s, when real anti-communist fervor gripped the country, through the 1970s and ’80s when there were these waves of state violence, including military operations in the countryside but also many clandestine covert operations in Guatemala City and other urban areas. The National Police had intimate and undeniable involvement in some of the worst acts of state terror and repression during the height of the conflict, that is, during the 1970s and ’80s. They were known as killers, torturers, kidnappers. They served as an instrument for the Guatemalan army for hunting down people they suspected to be either armed guerrillas or militants or subversives or leftists or people who they just didn&#8217;t like, who thought a different way or talked a different way or imagined a different Guatemala. The peace negotiators basically considered them unreformable and ordered them abolished.</p>\n<p>Their records ended up on a sprawling police base in Zone 6 of Guatemala City, a busy working-class neighborhood downtown. They were shut up inside an abandoned cluster of buildings inside this big base that had a lot of different barracks and activities and all kinds of things going on. Fast forward to 2005, when residents of that neighborhood called the government’s human rights prosecutor and asked for his help in determining whether weapons and munitions were being stored properly on the base. In the course of that somewhat routine inspection of the base, the investigators found these documents, and that is how this enormous, abandoned, moldering collection of documents — millions and millions of historical files of the abolished National Police — came to be found.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253825" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-102279776-1559949284.jpg" alt="Employees work behind pictures of persons disappeared during the internal armed conflict (1960-1996), in La Verbena cemetery during activities in commemoration of the National Day of Forced Disappearances held in Guatemala City, on June 21, 2010.

They were massacred by the military. But there were also these covert campaigns to hunt out subversives in the cities. The most common method of dealing with [people labeled subversives] was to disappear them; they would be snatched off the street and taken to some clandestine detention center and tortured, interrogated, and then secretly killed and their bodies disposed of. There were, in the 1970s and ’80s, and there still are today, tens of thousands of people who are listed as disappeared people, and there continues to be this incredibly pressing and painful question for the families of those disappeared people as to what happened, where are they, and who did this, and can they ever find their bodies? Some of the things that were immediately found on this police base in this collection of deteriorating files were lists of some of those people.</p>\n<p>They were clearly lists of people who were targeted by the various military regimes that succeeded each other during that period; sometimes they were just lists of names, but if you looked at lists of the disappeared from that era, they were immediately recognizable. The lists often had check marks or little red crosses next to them, or names were crossed out — these were working lists that people were using. It was so immediately evident from your first encounter with this pile of papers that there was information in there about how repression was executed in Guatemala. There were files called “assassinations” and files called “kidnapping”!</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;Lists often had check marks next to them, or names were crossed out. There were files called &#8216;assassinations&#8217; and files called &#8216;kidnapping&#8217;!&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>The first thing that the human rights prosecutor at the time, Sergio Morales, had to do upon being alerted by his team that [there] was this enormous, decaying pile of files sitting there on the base and that no one on the base seemed to know their significance, was to immediately put in place some kind of legal protection for the archive. They had to protect the documents from the government once the government found out what they had. In a very smart move, Morales went to a judge to get an order of protection that essentially gave his office the right to use and access and preserve those files as they saw fit.</p>\n<p><b>What are some of the landmark cases in which documents from the archives have been instrumental? </b></p>\n<p>One example is the burning of the Spanish Embassy in 1980. Indigenous activists had come from their communities to Guatemala City to protest the seizure of their land by large plantation owners, and they holed up in the Spanish embassy, effectively taking the embassy and everybody in it hostage. The embassy said, “You&#8217;re welcome to stay, we don&#8217;t have a problem with that,” but the government turned the police on them, and the police burned the embassy down, and every single person who was inside except for the ambassador and one other person was burned to death. That moment really showed how determined and brutal the government was to stamp out any opposition. There was a trial about that incident, and there were many relevant police records that the staff of the Police Archive found and analyzed and presented in an expert report in support of the prosecution.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253827" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_050131019098-1559949537.jpg" alt="Catarina mourns the deth of her sister during the 25th Anniversary of the attack to the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City, Monday, Jan 31, 2005.

And the military and police went after her family and kidnapped her 14-year-old brother, Marco Antonio, and disappeared him as a kind of revenge. That case <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/guatemala-ex-military-officers-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity">just was heard last year</a>. It ended up getting some of the most senior military officials who have been convicted at trial, and that was partially due to police records. Then there was the <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB273/index.htm">case of Edgar Fernando García</a>, who was a leftist, a labor leader, and a member of the Guatemalan Communist Party, who was kidnapped and disappeared in 1984. They found an extraordinary set of documents in the Police Archive, including one that names the four police who kidnapped him: It was actually an announcement that they were getting an award for their role in his arrest or capture. That was an extraordinary case, not just because they actually tracked down two of the four men who snatched him away from a public market but also because there was <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB440/">a follow-up trial</a> several years later of their superior, who was the commander of the police corps that they were part of, and of his superior, who was the police chief, a retired military officer named Colonel Héctor Bol de la Cruz. These documents have led to very high-level convictions of senior military and police officers.</p>\n<p><b>How does it function for the general public — can they visit the archive and request documents on friends and family members? How is it being used to look for missing persons, to bring families closure, or more generally as a cultural entity?</b></p>\n<p>It has been very powerfully used by families of the disappeared and by those who survived but also by scholars, historians, journalists, and investigators — all kinds of people, both Guatemalan and not Guatemalan. The archive has essentially opened its doors without restrictions to anyone. They made a very considered decision early on, which was the product of a number of public discussions, to not censor or restrict the documents in any way. It was controversial among archivists. Though the documents are absolutely chock-full of private information — some of it true, some of it absolutely made up by police — they made the decision that they could not be responsible for censoring information that they felt Guatemalans had the right to know. Many thousands of people have flocked to the archive to read those records, and it&#8217;s been a very powerful source of information about that terrible period for many people.</p>\n<p><b>What has happened since last August when the archives director was abruptly removed? Who fired him, and what were the reasons given? Who is in charge now?</b></p>\n<p>About 10 years ago, a handful of employees had been dismissed by the director of the archive, Gustavo Meoño Brenner — who was the only director the archives had ever had, until now. They felt that they were wrongly dismissed, and they filed a labor complaint, which worked its way through the system for a ridiculously long time because the system is slow and dysfunctional. And in 2017, this dispute was finally resolved by a judge in favor of the employees. The judge ruled that the Ministry of Culture — the overseer of the archive — owed many hundreds of thousands of <i>quetzales</i> in back pay to these dismissed employees.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>&#8220;The documents are absolutely chock-full of private information. But they could not censor information they felt Guatemalans had the right to know.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>There always has been an acute political animus against Meoño — who was a very senior figure in the EGP, one of the guerrilla groups active in the 1970s and ’80s — on the part of the right in Guatemala. Long before the labor dispute, Meoño had been the target of overt, very explicit expressions of hatred, smear campaigns, and legal actions from extreme right-wing figures and retired military hard-liners. These same people also have been openly disgusted with the very existence of this archive and what it does, especially since this archive has, among many other functions, served as a source for information that has become evidence in criminal trials against some of these same retired military and police figures.</p>\n<p>Then you have this labor dispute that suddenly makes the government liable for hundreds of thousands of <i>quetzales</i>, due to, according to the ruling, an improper action on the part of Meoño. So that is what began a series of increasingly intensive inquiries, by first the government and then the United Nations Development Program [which coordinates foreign funding for the archive]. This culminated in the extremely abrupt decision to essentially fire Meoño by saying his contract is up for negotiation and we&#8217;re not going to renew it. But it was done in a very abrasive and abrupt way; there was no warning to the staff, and it was very upsetting to everybody. Meoño had led the archive for 13 years and led it with incredible effectiveness. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how much he did to bring this thing from a state of grotesque, abandoned piles of paper to an ordered collection of scanned and archived records.</p>\n<p>So the crisis began last summer with the firing of Meoño without any kind of plan on the part of the government or civil society or UNDP because nobody was prepared for it. That crisis led to increasing involvement and interest in the archive on the part of the Morales government — first the Ministry of Culture and now the Ministry of Interior, which has just revealed that they have plans to reinsert themselves back into the administration of the archive. And that is a very alarming development.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253829" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_111109195714-1559949678.jpg" alt="ADVANCE FOR USE THURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2011 AND THEREAFTER - In this Thursday, Nov. 3,  2011 photo, bundles of documents to be organized and digitally scanned sit in piles at the former National Police archive in Guatemala City.

Or documents be removed? </b></p>\n<p>I have very specific concerns about that. Minister of Interior Enrique Degenhart <a href="https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/justicia/ministro-degenhart-dice-que-archivo-de-la-policia-nacional-debe-pasar-a-manos-de-la-pnc/">held a press conference</a> on Monday, May 27, during which he explicitly said that access to the information in that archive was going to be reviewed and that the rules of the access would be changed. He repeatedly used the access to information law — which is akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and which, just like our FOIA, is meant to provide the public with access to reserved government information. He used that same law to invoke restrictions that should be placed on this archive. Because the Guatemalan access to information law has, like many such laws, restrictions on material that, if released, could damage national security or expose ongoing law enforcement operations. So he was citing that law to say that the unfettered access that people have been able to have to the Guatemalan police archive has to end, because the access to information law requires that information be restricted on the basis of such issues as national security.</p>\n<p>I have concerns that a minister of the Morales government, who is very much a part of the most extreme right-wing and who is very much aligned with the hard-line military and retired military intelligence, will be in some way in control of or in command of this archive. He also said at his press conference that the government was looking into legal action against two entities that have backup copies of archive documents: the Swiss government and the University of Texas at Austin. So that raises a whole slew of concerns about the safety of these records, the safety of the paper file, the safety of the servers, the computer systems, the safety of the staff. It’s very troubling and scary.</p>\n<p><b>Do you see this situation with the archive as a reflection of the overall tenor of Morales&#8217;s administration? He&#8217;s known to be connected to and supported by the extreme right-wing and military hard-liners. Do you see a connection with </b><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/07/guatemala-anti-corruption-trolls-smear-campaign/"><b>Morales’s actions against</b></a><b> the U.N.-backed anti-corruption commission known as CICIG, for instance?</b></p>\n<p>I see his decision to move in on the archive as absolutely consistent with his attacks on human rights, justice, rule of law, and anti-corruption initiatives in the country. These are attacks that have been unfolding incrementally during the course of his term in office, but in the past year, they have rapidly accelerated. One of the first and most dramatic gestures or attacks was to order that CICIG<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/world/americas/guatemala-corruption-commission-united-nations.html"> be closed prematurely</a>, to revoke the visas of the foreign staff, to harass and smear [CICIG director] Iván Velásquez, generally denigrate the work of CICIG, and in fact, lobby the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress very heavily to participate in that campaign to shut down CICIG. And it has done so with a tremendous amount of success, I&#8217;m sad to say.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253831" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-1079242720-morales-1559950083-1024x682.jpg" alt="Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales (front-L), flanked by Vice-President Jafeth Cabrera (front-R) and his cabinet, gives a statement at the Culture Palace in Guatemala City on January 7, 2019. - Morales announced an immediate end to the UN-sponsored anti-corruption commission, CICIG." /></p>\n<p class="caption">Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, center, gives a statement at the Culture Palace in Guatemala City on Jan. 7, 2019, where he announced an immediate end to the UN-sponsored anti-corruption commission, CICIG.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo: Noé Pérez/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>There have been ongoing campaigns to harass and torment [opponents] through social media and through frivolous legal actions. The government has spent an inordinate amount of time targeting human rights defenders, land and water defenders, feminists, Indigenous rights activists — you name it, the government has found a way to go after them.</p>\n<p>The Morales government has already turned its attention to other archives that have human rights implications. According to <a href="https://elperiodico.com.gt/nacion/2019/03/27/el-organismo-judicial-se-queda-sin-jefes-de-areas-importantes/">press reports</a><i>, </i>the government pressured the head of the archive of a body that’s akin to the Justice Department — a key collection of historic and current court records, including the files of open cases that have not yet gone to trial — to resign, and there has been no replacement for her. That archive of the judicial body is now very vulnerable, and there&#8217;s a lot of concern that those files are being raided or could be raided in the future. The government has also laid off staff at the National Archives that worked on a special collection of records that came out of the old<i> Estado Mayor Presidencial</i>, or the Presidential General Staff, which was another entity of the Guatemalan government in the past that was inextricably intertwined with the worst of the violent repression, kidnapping, torture, and so forth, and which was also disbanded by the peace accords.</p>\n<p>So the police archive attack is not an isolated attack. They know the value of these records, and they have gone after them in a way that is very much in keeping with Morales’s attention to human rights and anti-corruption efforts in the country and finding ways of dismantling them.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;They know the value of these records and they have gone after them.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p><b>Why is the </b><b>United Nations Development Program</b><b> going along with the administration in this decision? Or is there some indication that they are not? </b></p>\n<p>The UNDP, as part of its mandate, must work with the government and that I understand. The UNDP has in the past, under different leadership, been a very important and vocal ally of the police archive. But in this case, the UNDP has tried to work in good faith with a government that is not itself working in good faith, and I think they&#8217;ve been politically terribly naive. They have failed in their mission to ensure that the archive remains under the oversight of the Ministry of Culture. Now time is running out: On June 30, the agreement [that ensures the archive stays with Culture] is over. But I suspect there will be many legal actions in support of the archive in order to preserve the status quo.</p>\n<p><b>Could those legal actions try to block its move to the Interior?</b></p>\n<p>Yes, basically, what [the current human rights prosecutor] Jordán Rodas Andrade has done is to file a legal action against the government, demanding that the government renegotiate the agreement so that the archive would remain with Culture.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p><b>Morales’s term is up this year, and Guatemalans will vote in an election without a clear front-runner on June 16. Will these problems end with his presidency? </b></p>\n<p>The attacks on the archive in Guatemala right now are not just an extension of the Morales government’s dislike for human rights. It&#8217;s part of a pattern, unfortunately, that exists broadly throughout Latin America. You see a regression on human rights justice in country after country — in Brazil, Argentina, Chile. In El Salvador, which after more than 25 years had just begun to bring human rights cases like for the El Mozote Massacre [in which a U.S.-trained military unit killed more than 600 civilians in a village in the country’s northeast] and is now in the middle of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/opinion/contributors/in-el-salvador-left-joins-right-in-asking-for-war-crimes-amnesty.html">debate about a new amnesty law</a> (as is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/world/americas/guatemala-vote-amnesty-war-crimes.html">the Guatemalan Congress</a>) — they haven’t even had a chance to try their very first case yet, and they&#8217;re already talking about reverting to amnesty. So I see what is happening in Guatemala as part and parcel with a very broad strategy on the part of the right in Latin America, and I would even say in the Americas so that I can include our own country.</p>\n<p>Three years ago, you would have had a U.S. ambassador who strongly spoke out in support of the archive and that would have been enough to send the signal that &#8220;you may be doing this, that, and the other thing, but do not mess with this.&#8221; And that hasn&#8217;t happened. The U.S. is virtually silent on this and many other subjects. As I said, the Morales administration has not only achieved the obstruction of CICIG, but it&#8217;s managed to bring people from the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress along with it. They&#8217;ve done <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/05/trump-republican-lawmakers-weaken-u-n-anti-corruption-commission-guatemala-jimmy-morales-white-house-putin/">a very effective lobbying campaign</a>, and there were people who were receptive to that: Sen. Marco Rubio, Rep. Chris Smith, people in the State Department. That&#8217;s also part of the problem here: We don&#8217;t have a lot of the powerful allies that we would have had just a handful of years ago.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/08/guatemala-historical-archive-national-police-jimmy-morales/">A Vast Archive Exposed the Secret History of Kidnapping and Assassination in Guatemala.

What happens to these individuals?&#8217;” She asked McGarrity, “How is that not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?”</p>\n<p>In the U.S., there is no criminal charge specifically for “domestic terrorism.” For example, white supremacist James Fields Jr., who killed Heather Heyer with his Dodge Challenger at the “Unite The Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was described as a domestic terrorist; even racist then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/jeff-sessions-speaks-doj-investigation-charlottesville-attack-49201717">said</a> the attack met the definition of &#8220;domestic terrorism.&#8221; Yet he was convicted for hate crimes, not on terror charges.</p>\n<p>Instead of being a legal category, “domestic terrorism” is used by federal law enforcement as a framework to organize and describe cases and investigations. But thanks to a recent shift in how the FBI classifies its domestic terror categories, the answer to Tlaib’s urgent question, “what happens” to white supremacist threats, writ large, is all the harder to discover.</p>\n<p>Over the last decade, the FBI classified domestic terrorism cases using 11 categories, including a specific grouping for white supremacists. At the end of April, the FBI and Justice Department revealed to Senate Judiciary Committee staffers that a new classification system was now in place, employing only four categories: racially motivated violent extremism; anti-government and anti-authority extremism; animal rights and environmental extremism; and abortion extremism.</p>\n<p>The “racially motivated” category is the most problematic one. Under an administration that has made a point of drawing <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/31/pittsburgh-shooting-anti-semitism-media-bias/">false equivalences</a> between deadly white supremacist violence and anti-racist dissent, the FBI’s category collapse is as unsurprising as it is disconcerting.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>The new nomenclature reflects the Trump administration’s ideological commitment to enabling white supremacists.</blockquote>\n<p><a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/right-wing-extremism-linked-to-every-2018-extremist-murder-in-the-us-adl-finds">According</a> to the Anti-Defamation League, between 2009 and 2018, white supremacist and far-right extremists were responsible for 73 percent of extremist murders in the U.S. Yet the distinct and deadly threat of white supremacist violence is now unnamed and merely folded into the too-broad “racially motivated extremism” category. That category folds in “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/black-identity-extremist-fbi-domestic-terrorism/">black identity extremism</a>” — an FBI category conjured in 2017 to make the unsubstantiated claim that black organizers fighting against racist police executions were a national security threat.</p>\n<p>The new nomenclature reflects the Trump administration’s ideological commitment to <a href="https://www.apnews.com/a36d40133acf40b5a0ddda2fa130736e">enabling</a> white supremacists. But the new classifications are more than semantic: They render it impossible for the public, or even elected officials, to know whether the FBI is dedicating resources to investigating the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/alt-right-campus-free-speech-adl-splc/">very real</a> threat of white supremacist terror or if those resources are going toward the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/black-identity-extremist-fbi-domestic-terrorism/">harassment</a> of Black Lives Matter and civil rights activists. Only the former use of government time and money would be justified, but both cases would fall under “racially motivated extremism.”</p>\n<p><u>Earlier this month,</u> the FBI’s inability to distinguish white supremacist, far-right terror cases in its data was made clear during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing. During his testimony, McGarrity, the same FBI official questioned this week by Tlaib, was asked by House members how many current domestic investigations were targeting white supremacists. He couldn’t answer with any specificity, save to say that 50 percent of current investigations related to the “racially motivated” category and that the “majority” of these involved white supremacists. Another 40 percent of investigations, he said, related to “anti-government” extremism, without delineating whether targets were right- or left-wing groups. So, while we can know that 90 percent of current domestic FBI investigations involve supposedly “racially motivated” or “anti-government” cases, we can’t know to what extent the agency is abusing these “terror” categories to persecute anti-racist activism and civil rights struggle — as federal law enforcement has historically done.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>“The FBI knows who it is investigating, but the public does not, and lawmakers tasked with oversight of powerful intelligence agencies aren’t able to check for abuse because of this purposeful obfuscation by the Bureau,” Sandy Fulton, government relations director of the advocacy group Free Press, told The Intercept via email. “Black protesters seeking justice in the face of institutional and official racism are not the same as white supremacists planning attacks on innocent people. The FBI should know the difference and be more fully accountable to the people it serves and the Constitution it’s sworn to uphold.”</p>\n<p>It would be unempirical at best to expect the FBI to end its historic practice of persecuting black dissent. Meanwhile, as the New York Times Magazine highlighted in a lengthy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/magazine/FBI-charlottesville-white-nationalism-far-right.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">report</a> last November, federal law enforcement has willfully ignored the growth of white supremacist extremism in the last decade, including suppressing findings in a 2009 report on the right-wing radicalization of veterans. As I <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/05/new-york-times-police-white-supremacy/">noted</a> at the time, white supremacy has not only been a blind spot for policing; U.S. law enforcement doesn’t do enough about violent racists because as an institution, it itself is violently racist and contains white supremacists in its ranks. The new categories give the FBI further cover for the same bad practices.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents.”</blockquote>\n<p>In a May <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20AG%20Barr%20and%20Director%20Wray%20on%20violent%20white%20supremacist%20threat,%205-2-19.pdf">letter</a> to Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray, six Democratic senators, including Sens. Dick Durbin, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris, rightly expressed concern about the new “racially motivated extremism” classification. “This new category,” they wrote, “inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents.” By the same token, the new “anti-government and anti-authority extremism” category makes no differentiation between far-right militias or left-wing radicals, the former constituting a rising deadly threat and the latter having been responsible for no deaths in the U.S. in over 20 years. It’s worth noting, too, that while “animal rights and environmental extremism” remains a category in the FBI’s terror taxonomy, no human or animal life has ever been lost in the U.S. because of militant animal rights and environmental activism.</p>\n<p>“The re-categorization is a significant tell,” said Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice and a former FBI agent. “Rather than be upfront about their methods and their use of the significant resources allocated to them by Congress, they chose to obscure this information.” As German told The Intercept, Congress has demanded greater transparency and more information about the FBI’s handling of white supremacist terror threats for well over six months.</p>\n<p>In late March, <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-schneider-introduce-legislation-to-combat-white-supremacist-terrorist-threat">following</a> the massacre at two mosques in New Zealand by a white supremacist, Durbin <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/894/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22white+supremacy%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=2">reintroduced</a> the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act with the specific aim of forcing federal agencies to be more transparent and accountable with regards to addressing white supremacist extremism. While Durbin’s bill has not yet passed and is by no means the answer to the festering scourge of American white supremacist violence, the Justice Department and FBI’s move toward even greater obfuscation is all the more disturbing as a response. As Free Press’s Fulton put it, “Lumping ‘white-supremacist’ terrorism into the broader and more vague category of &#8216;racially motivated&#8217; terrorism allows the FBI to hide the fact that it’s not putting enough resources into investigating the rising threat of violent racism in the United States.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/08/white-supremacist-domestic-terrorism-fbi-justice/">Trump Administration Is Making It Harder to Find Out Whether It’s Fighting White Supremacist Terror</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>The Chinese government</u> appears to have launched a major new internet crackdown, blocking the country’s citizens from accessing The Intercept’s website and those of at least seven other Western news organizations.</p>\n<p>On Friday, people in China began reporting that they could not access the websites of The Intercept, The Guardian, the Washington Post, HuffPost, NBC News, the Christian Science Monitor, the Toronto Star, and Breitbart News.</p>\n<p>It is unclear exactly when the censorship came into effect or the reasons for it. But Tuesday marked the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and Chinese authorities have reportedly increased levels of online censorship to coincide with the event.</p>\n<p>Charlie Smith, co-founder of GreatFire.org, an organization that monitors Chinese government internet censorship, said that the apparent crackdown on Western news sites represented a significant new development and described it as a “censorship Black Friday.”</p>\n<p>“This frenzied activity could indicate that the authorities are accelerating their push to sever the link between Chinese citizens and any news source that falls outside of the influence of The Party,” said Smith, referencing the ruling Communist Party regime.</p>\n<p>For years, China has blocked several Western news organizations after they have published stories that reflect negatively on the government. The New York Times, Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and Reuters have all previously been censored, rendering their websites inaccessible in the country.</p>\n<p>China operates an internet censorship system known as the Great Firewall, which uses filtering equipment to stop people in the country from accessing content published on banned websites that are operated outside China’s borders.</p>\n<p>It is possible to circumvent the censorship using tools such as a virtual private network, or VPN. However, use of technology that bypasses the Great Firewall is banned — and people in the country who sell access to these services have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/man-in-china-sentenced-to-five-years-jail-for-running-vpn">jailed</a>.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>In the last year, The Intercept has published a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/">series</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/09/14/google-china-prototype-links-searches-to-phone-numbers/">of</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/29/google-china-censored-search/">reports</a> revealing Google’s plan to launch a <a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/google-dragonfly-china/">censored search engine in China</a>. The reports highlighted the extensive online blocking in China of information about human rights, democracy, peaceful protest, and religion. They also revealed secretive, high-level meetings between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official named Wang Huning.</p>\n<p>Within China, censorship in recent weeks increased as the country prepared for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square uprisings, a series of student protests that were violently suppressed by the army, leading to more than 10,000 civilian deaths, according to some <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html">estimates</a>.</p>\n<p>Prior to the anniversary, on June 4, Chinese internet users reported widespread censorship on social media websites.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>All sewage sludge</u> recently tested by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection was contaminated with PFAS chemicals, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6131524-PFAS-Summary-of-Compost-Data-053019.html">documents</a> <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6131523-PFAS-Summary-of-Sludge-Data-053019.html">obtained</a> by The Intercept. The state tested the sludge, solid waste that remains after the treatment of domestic and industrial water, for the presence of three “<a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/bad-chemistry/">forever chemicals</a>”: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/dupont-chemistry-deception/">PFOA</a>, PFOS, and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/02/10/pfos-pfoa-epa-chemical-contamination/">PFBS</a>. Of 44 samples taken from Maine farms and other facilities that distribute compost made from the sludge, all contained at least one of the PFAS chemicals. In all but two of the samples, the chemicals exceeded safety thresholds for sludge that Maine set early last year.</p>\n<p>In March, the state <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dep/news/news.html?id=1186570">announced</a> that it would temporarily halt the land application of sludge and begin the testing, after milk from a <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20180201/dairy-farm-contaminated-kkwwds-kimball-lane-well">dairy farm</a> in Arundel, Maine, was found to be contaminated with PFAS that had likely come from sludge that the farmers had spread on their land as fertilizer. These results, which have not yet been published or reported, are from the first round of testing. An additional 28 samples were collected but the results of their testing are not yet available.</p>\n<p>While Maine is leading the nation by setting limits for the chemicals and testing sludge to see if it meets them, local environmentalists fear that the state’s levels — 2.5 parts per billion for PFOA, 5.2 ppb for PFOS, and 1,900 ppb for PFBS — may not be stringent enough. “They’re probably about 10 times weaker than they should be,” said Mike Belliveau, executive director of the Environmental Health Strategy Center in Portland. “Even low parts-per-billion levels of PFAS in sludge can threaten the health of the food supply.”</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="promote-embed" data-promo="bad-chemistry" data-crop="promo"></div></p>\n<p>David Burns, director of the Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management at the Maine DEP, said that the state set the safety thresholds for sludge based on available toxicological information and that it chose those three chemicals because more is known about them than other PFAS. He said Maine will probably screen sludge for more compounds in the future.</p>\n<p>Burns also said that, at farms where sludge has been found to have elevated PFAS levels, the state has authorized testing of the soil where it would be spread. If those tests “exceed a screening level, they’re prohibited from spreading the sludge on those sites,” he said. “But some sites have not exceeded the level so we’ve been able to authorize spreading.”</p>\n<p>The evidence of widespread sludge contamination comes just days after a Food and Drug Administration study revealed that PFAS chemicals were also found in food. The investigation, which was conducted by FDA chemists but made public by the <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/health/2019/06/03/fda-high-levels-pfas-chocolate-cake/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> and the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2019/06/fda-tests-confirm-suspicions-about-pfas-chemicals-food">Environmental Working Group</a>, detected 16 PFAS chemicals in food samples collected from grocery stores in the mid-Atlantic region. Among them were PFOS, which was in almost half of the meat and seafood products (ground turkey, tilapia, and shrimp had particularly high levels); PFBA, which was found in pineapple; and PFHxS in sweet potato. A slice of chocolate cake with icing was found to have extremely high levels of a chemical called PFPeA.</p>\n<p>All PFAS chemicals persist indefinitely in the environment, and many have been shown to harm people. PFOA and PFOS, the two best-known in the class, have been linked to developmental, reproductive, and immune effects, as well as cancers, thyroid disease, and obesity — <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/30/pfoa-and-pfos-cause-lower-sperm-counts-and-smaller-penises-study-finds/">among other health problems</a>. PFBS, which 3M introduced in 2003 as a replacement for PFOS, also accumulates in the blood and livers of rats, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4363240-8-E-Filing-2008-May.html">report</a> the company sent to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2008. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4363242-8-E-Filing-2010-Feb.html">Another adverse incident report</a> from 3M showed that PFBS affects the livers of mice, as well as their cholesterol and fat levels. And according to a 2015 <a href="https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2015/05/978-87-93352-15-5.pdf">report</a> from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, PFBS affects both placental cells and neurodevelopment, and has been found in particularly high levels in children with asthma.</p>\n<p>While the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/chemicals/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas">says</a> it is “working to better understand the potential dietary exposure to PFAS,” researchers have already clearly shown that vegetables can <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es500016s">absorb PFAS chemicals</a> from the soil into their leaves. And the EPA has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/pfos_health_advisory_final_508.pdf">noted</a> that diet is likely the primary source of human exposure to PFOS.</p>\n<p>Indeed, though the EPA has failed to set PFAS standards for sludge, the agency has long been aware of the problem. As The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/toxic-firefighting-foam-has-contaminated-u-s-drinking-water-with-pfcs/">reported</a> in 2015, the agency knew back in 2009 that sludge from a wastewater treatment facility in Decatur, Alabama, contained PFOA and PFOS. From there, the toxic sludge made its way to nearby fields and, for 12 years, had been spread across 5,000 acres of local grazing land. Later testing confirmed that the chemicals had contaminated animals and humans in the rural area.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>The latest test results should set off another alarm — and not just in Maine. State environmental authorities discovered the three PFAS chemicals in sludge because they looked for them. But sludge is widely used on farms around the country. There are thousands of PFAS compounds, which may also be making their way into soil, water, and our food. And most states have not looked for contamination. According to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776589/">2013</a> study, it is there to be found: Researchers tested for 13 PFAS compounds in sludge from 94 wastewater treatment plants in 32 states and found at least 10 of the chemicals in every sample.</p>\n<p>In Maine, Belliveau thinks the discovery of toxic industrial chemicals entering our food supply through sludge may be a turning point. “I’m hoping there will now be a strong consensus to phase out the entire class,” he said. “These compounds simply cannot be used without permanently threatening the environment.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/07/pfas-chemicals-maine-sludge/">Toxic PFAS Chemicals Found in Maine Farms Fertilized With Sewage Sludge</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

Hakeem Jeffries, eased into Crowley&#8217;s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/29/hakeem-jeffries-joe-crowley-house-democratic-caucus-chair/">vacated leadership position</a> in the House of Representatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The loss, party bosses concluded, could be weathered and was the result of getting taken by surprise — something they wouldn’t let happen again. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Queens is about to have its first competitive district attorney’s race in almost 30 years, and the machine is ready. The contest, set for June 25, bears some striking similarities to the Ocasio-Cortez/Crowley battle that fell on June 26 a year earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crowded field has been narrowed to two front-runners. On one side is 31-year-old queer Latina Tiffany Cabán, a former public defender running on an aggressively reformist agenda: end cash bail, stop criminalizing poverty, and broadly roll back mass incarceration and the war on drugs. She has the backing of the Working Families Party, Democratic Socialists of America, and a slew of community groups. She recently picked up the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/22/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-tiffany-caban/">endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez</a>, who has been pounding her email list and social media feed to raise small dollars for Cabán, and on Thursday she won the backing of radical Philadelphia DA <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/20/larry-krasner-philadelphia-da/">Larry Krasner</a>.</span></p>\n<p>On the other side is the machine, in the form of Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, who has the backing of Crowley, the state’s elected officials, and the area’s major real estate developers. Cabán&#8217;s campaign ad, released on Friday, takes direct aim at Katz.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m a queer Latina from a working-class family.

She campaigned for Crowley in the pivotal race that eventually saw Ocasio-Cortez unseat him from his 10-year reign representing New York’s 7th, and later the 14th, congressional district. Crowley heavily backed Katz’s 2013 campaign to become borough president, presided over her swearing-in the following year, and has personally backed her campaign for DA. Crowley’s campaign committee, Joe for New York, gave Katz $2,750 in May. </span></p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'>\n<a href="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_18333691215068-melinda-katz-laguardia-airport-1559768805.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253348" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_18333691215068-melinda-katz-laguardia-airport-1559768805-1024x710.jpg" alt="AP_18333691215068-melinda-katz-laguardia-airport-1559768805" /></a></p>\n<p class="caption">From left, Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New York Gov.

Greg Meeks, Carolyn Maloney, and Tom Suozzi. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is planning to hold a fundraiser for Katz on June 10, effectively throwing in his endorsement, the New York Post </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/03/cuomo-backs-queens-da-candidate-melinda-katz-with-planned-fundraiser/"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Monday. (He called her “Melissa” in an </span><a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/governor-cuomo-end-session-wish-list/"><span style="font-weight: 400">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the next day with WNYC’s Brian Lehrer.) Cuomo also backed Katz’s bid for borough president in 2013.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Katz is running as a progressive who’ll advance criminal justice reforms, but she’s shifted her position on a number of related issues over the course of her DA campaign. She initially supported New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to build four new borough-based jails and close Rikers Island, but </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/26/tiffany-caban-queens-district-attorney/"><span style="font-weight: 400">since March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, she’s come out against the plan. Katz similarly campaigned on ending cash bail only for misdemeanors and violent felonies but now wants to end cash bail for all crimes. She has said she’d decline to prosecute low-level marijuana offenses, but while several of her opponents have designated a list of other crimes they’d decline to prosecute — including all recreational drug use and fare evasion — Katz said in response to a January DSA questionnaire that she still </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k6hPt7Slx3cPDwHgLvp_cRheBTj47ZJW/view"><span style="font-weight: 400">wants to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> “consider each arrest on its merits before declining to prosecute.” Reached for comment, Grant Fox, a spokesperson for the Katz campaign, said she’s always been completely opposed to cash bail and that she would also decline to prosecute sex work. She also supports a bill in the Assembly that would allow inmates over 55 who have served at least 15 years of their sentence to be eligible for parole, Fox said.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Melinda has always been consistent in her complete opposition to cash bail,” said Fox. “And she has always stood against the city&#8217;s process for closing Rikers and building massive new jails in four Boroughs. She&#8217;s sent multiple letters to the city opposing their process, and partnered with Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. in opposing the city&#8217;s plan. Her position is clear: she does not support building a massive 1,500-person jail anywhere in Queens. In fact, she&#8217;s the only one backing a real solution to close Rikers and bring inmates closer to their communities in smaller Borough-based jails. Others in the race are backing ridiculous proposals to either rebuild Rikers or close it without any plans for what to do with the current population.”</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>Katz has run for at least six different elected offices in New York over the past 25 years.</blockquote></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Katz has run for at least six different elected offices in New York over the past 25 years. In between her roles as New York City Council member and Queens borough president, she </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/2019/04/08/more-than-a-quarter-of-this-queens-da-candidates-donations-are-from-real-estate-players/"><span style="font-weight: 400">lobbied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for real estate clients at Greenberg Traurig. The law firm’s political action committee <a href="https://qns.com/story/2013/04/10/beep-hopefuls-have-ties-to-lobbying-cash/">donated</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">$1,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to her 2013 campaign, and she received at least 36 individual donations from Greenberg Traurig employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Katz </span><span style="font-weight: 400">opened up a</span><a href="https://queenscountypolitics.com/2018/01/19/katz-looks-become-citys-first-jewish-woman-mayor/"><span style="font-weight: 400"> new citywide campaign committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last January, Katz 2021, as rumors floated that she was contemplating a mayoral run. Katz said she wanted “to explore how I can serve the city I love long after my tenure as Borough President has ended.” Crowley hosted a fundraiser for her that February where donors could be her “Cupid&#8221; or “Valentine,” or buy her a “Rose,” with respective contributions of $4,950, $2,500, or $1,000, Queens County Politics reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Katz was running for New York State Assembly in 1994, the Daily News described her candidacy as “bucking the Queens Democratic Machine with a mini-machine of her own.” She positioned herself as something of an insurgent for the time, running on fighting for tenants’ rights and prosecuting organized crime. She also touted her stance against granting parole for Robert Chambers, who killed Jennifer Levin in Central Park in 1986. “We’re no longer going to accept representation solely as political reward and as patronage,” she told the Daily News. She’s since cozied up to Crowley and other mentors, making inroads with the monied New York interests that have helped her raise close to $1 million so far in her campaign for DA. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Katz moved through the New York political scene, from the state Assembly to City Council to borough president, she morphed into part of the very machine she started out running against.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she first ran, Katz was a staunch supporter of the death penalty. When she and Crowley served together in the Assembly, they both approved a 1994 death penalty measure to override a veto from then-Gov. Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo’s father. Both voted again in support of the death penalty in 1995, when seven black assembly members, including then-assemblyman Greg Meeks, voted against the measure, citing its disproportionate impact on the black community. Katz now </span><a href="https://observer.com/2009/08/weprin-raises-the-death-penalty-katz-and-yassky-explain/"><span style="font-weight: 400">opposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the death penalty and has acknowledged its disparate effects on communities of color. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even as Katz flipped on the death penalty, she pushed forward other measures that would increase incarceration and lengthen sentences for a variety of misdemeanor offenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a City Council member from 2002 to 2009, Katz sponsored legislation to increase penalties for minor offenses like </span><a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=444506&amp;GUID=1AEC2E12-6E6C-4AF4-AA48-286362495EC9&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search="><span style="font-weight: 400">graffiti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=442176&amp;GUID=069B2314-E7FB-4A2E-B026-0C86CA90DDAA&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search="><span style="font-weight: 400">drag racing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. She voted to create a new crime of gang recruitment, while experts testified that such laws indiscriminately target innocent young people of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2002, she </span><a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=437485&amp;GUID=693C28F1-B5B9-4FA4-AD6E-D998281CFFA4&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search"><span style="font-weight: 400">co-sponsored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a City Council resolution that sought to continue the city’s funding for police salaries under the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The COPS Office was established as part of the 1994 crime bill, which is now </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/14/amy-klobuchar-criminal-justice/"><span style="font-weight: 400">widely understood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to have played a role in driving up the incarcerated population in the U.S. The program was designed to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400">increase police presence, to expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance public safety.” </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s been tone deaf at times too, suggesting a disconnect from the movement energizing criminal justice reform. After the 2015 </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/11/us/chapel-hill-shooting/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that killed three Muslim students near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus, Katz posted on Facebook: “Prayers for the families and friends of #ChapelHillShooting victims. #AllLivesMatter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2018, Katz’s borough president campaign </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180402/POLITICS/180339984/the-histories-rainmakers-relationships-and-clients-that-make-these-lobbying-firms-the-city-s-biggest"><span style="font-weight: 400">accepted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> $16,565 from Constantinople &amp; Vallone consulting and its employees; the firm represents the private prison operator GEO Group. Asked for comment, Katz’s spokesperson Fox said Katz “opposes private prisons, period. Singling her out for taking money from Constantinople &amp; Vallone is disingenuous when Rory Lancman has taken money from them and Tiffany Cabán has been happy to accept endorsements from Senator Ramos and Assemblyman Quart who took their money as well.” Hannah Jeffrey, a spokesperson for Lancman, asked if Fox was referring to a $250 contribution from Anthony Constantinople in 2018.</span></p>\n<p class="p1">“Since Melinda Katz has no courtroom experience, we understand why she’s failing to make a coherent argument. The facts remain: Tiffany Cabán is running against the powerful real estate interests that have bankrolled Katz throughout her career,&#8221; Monica Klein, spokesperson for the Cabán campaign, said in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Katz’s connections to the real estate industry have bolstered her numerous campaigns, and she’s collected at least $158,300 this cycle from real estate industry donors, The City </span><a href="https://thecity.nyc/2019/05/queens-da-hopeful-melinda-katz-rakes-in-developer-dollars.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. During her 2009 run for city comptroller, the New York Times editorial board </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/opinion/24mon4.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> former City Council member David Yassky (who now directs state policy for Cuomo); the board wrote that while “Katz has been a smart, dynamic leader of the Land Use Committee,” they were “less enthusiastic about her connections to the real estate community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a city like New York where residents are in the throes of a massive affordability crisis, progressives are concerned that the Democratic machine is pushing someone with such close ties to the real estate industry. Cabán is the only candidate in the DA race who’s outright rejected both real estate and corporate PAC money, following the lead of other New York politicians including Ocasio-Cortez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s been in politics her whole life, and she’s raised more money than anybody else — much of it from real estate and other donors who progressives should have concerns about,” Bill Lipton, co-founder of the Working Families Party, told The Intercept. “People are wondering whether there’s gonna be working-class people living here at all 10 to 20 years from now, if not sooner,” he said. “Every elected official likes to say that they’re gonna fight for the community.” Not taking real estate and corporate PAC money “is a litmus test that demonstrates that you’re authentic and serious about it. It’s a new kind of politics that Bernie Sanders’s campaign demonstrated the viability for: of grassroots contributions powering insurgent campaigns that authentically want to represent working-class, middle-class and poor families.” </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As chair of the City Council’s Land Use Committee, Katz </span><a href="https://observer.com/2009/05/a-queens-girl-at-home-with-the-old-boys-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400">received contributions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from developers and real estate moguls with business before the committee. Between 2006 and 2008, members of the Willets Point Industry and Realty Association, a coalition of area business owners, gave $45,000 to Katz’s City Council campaign, the New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/nyregion/09willets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. In 2008, while chairing the Land Use Committee, Katz helped approve a Willets Point </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/nyregion/13willets.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">redevelopment project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which included allocating 800 homes for families making less than $38,400 a year. Employees of the project developers, Tully Construction and Tully Environmental, have given at least $12,130 to Katz between 2006 and 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2007, Katz </span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/council-members-cashing-big-time-campaign-cash-lobbyists-article-1.374956"><span style="font-weight: 400">sponsored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> legislation to allow the installation of billboards on scaffolding and sidewalk sheds. She received at least $80,000 from billboard companies, including Van Wagner Communications, in her 2009 comptroller campaign, the New York Daily News reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As borough president, Katz also </span><a href="https://qns.com/story/2018/05/17/target-project-in-elmhurst-gets-go-ahead-from-katz/"><span style="font-weight: 400">supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a largely unpopular rezoning plan to build a housing unit and a Target center in Queens, a project Ocasio-Cortez opposed for its lack of affordable units. Yeheskel Elias, CEO of the Heskel Group, the plan’s developer, </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/2018/06/18/queens-group-raises-red-flags-over-heskel-group-ceos-donations-to-elected-officials/"><span style="font-weight: 400">contributed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> $3,850 to Katz.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asked about Katz’s ties to real estate, Fox said she’s been an advocate for residents against industry interests. “Melinda has an unbeatable record of standing up to powerful interests at every level of government that she&#8217;s served in and winning fights on behalf of the people she represents. On the City Council she changed the culture of the Land Use Committee that she chaired and cost developers millions of dollars when she fought for fair wages and safe work sites at new developments. As Borough President, she&#8217;s taken on real estate interests and opposed developments from Astoria to Jamaica that didn&#8217;t have enough affordable housing or weren&#8217;t using union labor.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strategists and organizers close to the race say they’re still expecting low turnout given the lack of knowledge around the DA’s office and the voting behaviors of the Queens electorate. But with Cabán’s most recent fundraising haul and endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez and Krasner, strategists say the establishment is taking note. “The machine is nervous,” said Klein. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/07/queens-new-york-district-attorney-race-melinda-katz/">Revenge of the Machine: New York Party Bosses Rally to Melinda Katz in Pivotal Prosecutor Race</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

His signature policy, the “freedom dividend,” would see every American receive $1000 each month, no strings attached. Yang has garnered enough support to secure a spot on the Democratic debate stage later this month, in spite of his total lack of political or government experience. On this week’s Deconstructed, Mehdi Hasan sits down with the candidate to talk about his platform, his qualifications, and why he seems to have attracted online interest from the alt-right.</p>\n<p><b>Mehdi Hasan: </b>I&#8217;m wondering what it is that attracts neo-Nazis to your campaign. You&#8217;re a progressive Democrat.</p>\n<p><b>Andrew Yang: </b>I believe that the problem that the truck driver is facing and the problem that the neo-Nazi is facing, it&#8217;s a disintegrating way of life. I mean, like obviously, their vision of the future is nothing we want.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Sorry, a neo-Nazi&#8217;s way of life is disintegrating? What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, you know, they look up and this is obviously, this is just me projecting because I don&#8217;t know what the heck goes through other peoples’ minds. But if they looked up and say &#8220;Hey, Donald Trump&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; and they&#8217;re like &#8220;Woah, wait, Donald Trump&#8217;s not necessarily the answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>[Music interlude.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Welcome to Deconstructed. I’m Mehdi Hasan. And that was Andrew Yang. Andrew who? Andrew Yang, my guest today, the 44-year-old former businessman and philanthropist who’s running for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>We need to accelerate both our economy and our society and I&#8217;m the man for that job because the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes MATH! That stands for &#8220;Make America Think Harder.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what this campaign&#8217;s going to do.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Andrew’s never held any elected office before but will be on the Democratic presidential debate stage in a few weeks time &#8211; and has, I think it’s fair to say, some very interesting views.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>When the robot trucks hit the highways in five to ten years, it&#8217;s going to be of epic disaster for hundreds of thousands of Americans in hundreds of communities around the country. I am running for president because we do not have that much time.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>So on this week’s show, where on earth did Andrew Yang come from, why is he running for president of the United States, and why has this progressive Asian American entrepreneur attracted the support of online Nazis?</p>\n<p><b>Seth Meyers: </b>Congressman Eric Swalwell announced last night he&#8217;s running for president.</p>\n<p><b>Newscaster: </b>Congressman Seth Moulton announced last night he&#8217;s running for president.</p>\n<p><b>Newscaster: </b>Pete Buttigieg —</p>\n<p>[Overlapping newscasters announcing 2020 candidates.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>At this point, it’s easier to keep track of which Democrats aren’t running for president than which Democrats are. There are just so many of them. The field for the Democratic nomination in 2020, in fact, includes more candidates than in any party primary for four decades.</p>\n<p>Last time I checked and, you know what, it may have gone up since the last time I checked, a whopping 24 — count ‘em, 24! — senators, governors, mayors, members of the house and of course a former vice-president of the United States, who’s currently leading the pack. They’re all running for the 2020 Democratic nomination. There’s even a guy who’s never served in government, never served in elected office of any kind who’s going to be on the debate stage later this month. He’s my guest, but we’ll come back to him in a moment.</p>\n<p>First off, why are so many Democrats running for office? It’s becoming a bit absurd, isn’t it? From where I’m sitting, there seem to be two types of candidates in this 2020 primary race: those running to win, like Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren.</p>\n<p><b>Elizabeth Warren: </b>The time for small ideas is over.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>And those running really just to raise their profiles, Representatives Tim Ryan or Seth Moulton, for example.</p>\n<p><b>Tim Ryan: </b>This election&#8217;s about the future and I will tell you that I understand what&#8217;s happening in the economy right now and I understand —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Ever heard of them? No? I can’t honestly blame you. And you can’t really blame them either — the nobodies and the underdogs — for running. There’s very little downside for them. It’s a long presidential campaign. You get CNN and MSNBC town halls all to yourself. If you qualify, you get to be on the televised debates. The first is in just a few weeks time. There’s two of them: 10 candidates a night, and you only need to show you have 65,000 donors and have reached 1% in three polls to make it onto the stage with the Bidens and the Bernies on one of those two nights. So, no matter how badly you do, no matter how weak your campaign is, your profile goes up. You might get a book deal out of it, or maybe even a cable news deal. This is America, the land of opportunity!</p>\n<p>The reality, though, is that this is a serious contest to decide who will face off against Donald Trump next year and we need to focus, people. Right now, you have Joe Biden way out ahead of the other candidates in the field, with really only six or seven other candidates in a position to even challenge or beat him next year.</p>\n<p><b>News pundit: </b>To hear Democrats tell it, Joe Biden is the man to beat for the Democratic presidential nomination. After all, he&#8217;s rocketing in the polls and his campaign is now swimming in the cash.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>So why waste our collective time and attention on the also-rans and the book-deal-chasers? Especially in the coming and crucial TV debates? Imagine how much oxygen these fringe candidates are going to suck up over the course of the two nights. What an annoying distraction, let&#8217;s be honest, some of them will be.</p>\n<p>Isn’t it more important to let the actual serious candidates, the grownups, if you will, debate, contest, challenge, one another?</p>\n<p>I mean, what is the point of John Delaney&#8217;s candidacy, a multimillionaire former Democratic member of Congress from Maryland, who says stuff like this in front of Democratic audiences and gets the reception he deserves.</p>\n<p><b>John Delaney: </b>Medicare for all may sound good but it&#8217;s actually not good policy nor is it good politics. I’m tellin’ you.</p>\n<p>[Crowd boos.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>To quote Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, “John Delaney, thank you but please sashay away.” Look, in a Democratic debate, I want to see Sanders and Warren spar over who gets the left vote. I want to see Harris and Biden clash over the 1994 Crime Bill. I want to see Buttigieg and Beto duke it out for the title of White Obama. I don’t want to see John Hickenlooper arguing with Eric Swalwell. I just don’t care. And be honest, you’re Googling who Hickenlooper and Swalwell are right now, aren’t you? There’s no shame in admitting. I’m not judging you.</p>\n<p>I’m judging the Democratic Party. The thing is, having so many candidates in the field, even weak candidates, makes everything unpredictable. And as much the Democrats need to have a proper contest over ideas and personalities in the run-up to 2020 — in a way that they didn’t in the run-up to 2016, when it was supposed to be a coronation for frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her other rivals, apart from Bernie, were only Martin O&#8217;Malley, Jim Webb and God help us, Lincoln Chaffee — unpredictability is not necessarily a good thing when you’re getting ready to take on this president and the Republican Party in 2020. I mean, just remember what happened to the GOP in 2016. Seventeen Republicans ran for president and the guy from Home Alone 2 won.</p>\n<p><b>Macaulay Culkin [in Home Alone 2]: </b>Excuse me, where&#8217;s the lobby?</p>\n<p><b>Donald J. Trump [in Home Alone 2]: </b>Down the hall and to the left.</p>\n<p><b>MC: </b>Thanks.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yeah, I’m still not over that. Then again, on other hand, I know I sometimes come across on this show, and on social media, on Twitter, as someone with very firm views, strong opinions, but I’d also like to think I’m open to new ideas. I’m open to being wrong. I’m open to being persuaded of another point of view.</p>\n<p>And in the case of the Democratic race, there is the quite valid counter-argument that having lots of candidates running has its advantages because certain issues get attention that might not otherwise get attention. Seth Moulton has raised the issue of mental health care, for example. Governor Jay Inslee has made a powerful, passionate, detailed case for how to combat climate change. Tulsi Gabbard, for all her many sins and flaws, and I’m no fan of Gabbard or her closeness to some very odious foreign leaders like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but she’s right to raise the issue of endless wars and the U.S. foreign policy establishment’s love for regime change.</p>\n<p>And my guest today is someone who is sounding the alarm bell about the threat posed by automation and artificial intelligence, AI, to jobs and to incomes in this country, and he has a novel, innovative and pretty radical plan to protect American workers from that threat with what he calls a Freedom Dividend and what the rest of us call a universal basic income.</p>\n<p>His name is Andrew Yang, he’s the 44-year-old entrepreneur, founder of a nonprofit called Venture for America, and he’s come out of literally nowhere in recent months, thanks to a very successful online operation involving all sorts of funny and not so funny memes, and a group of diehard supporters dubbed the Yang Gang. They’ve helped him net enough individual donors to qualify for the first Democratic debates on the 26th and 27th of June, and his donors, by the way, include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Hollywood star Nicolas Cage.</p>\n<p>Andrew Yang joins me now. Andrew Yang, welcome to Deconstructed.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>It&#8217;s great to be here. Thanks for having me.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> Andrew, I don&#8217;t want you to take this the wrong way, but for those of our listeners who have never heard of you, who are you and why are you running for president?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, I&#8217;m a serial entrepreneur who spent the last six or seven years helping create several thousand jobs in the Midwest and the South and I became convinced that the reason why Donald Trump is our president today is that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, all the swing States he needed to win. And my friends in technology know that what we did to the manufacturing jobs, we will now do to the retail jobs, the call center jobs, the fast food jobs, the truck driving jobs and on and on through the economy. So, I&#8217;m running for president to help wake up America to the fact that it is not immigrants that are causing these dislocations. It is advancing technology and then proposing real solutions that will help us manage this transition.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> When you decided to run, you must have thought to yourself, &#8220;No one like me has ever run before for the Democratic nomination let alone won it.&#8221; I mean, even on the Republican side you have Donald Trump obviously, who won in 2016 against all odds, but he was still a household name when he entered the race. The media was obsessed with him from day one. With respect, that doesn&#8217;t apply to you or the companies that you ran in the past.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> And yet, here I am, one of the thirteen candidates who&#8217;s qualified for the Democratic primary debates on the basis of both polling and grassroots donations.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Fair point.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> I&#8217;m about to break through 130,000 donations, which will qualify me for the September and October debates if I poll as well. So, we&#8217;re in an unprecedented time. We need meaningful solutions and just doing what has been done before will not help us solve the problems of the 21st Century.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>You talk about the debates and you have qualified for the debates in Miami as you say, later this month. You got the one percent in the polls. You got the 65,000 donors, as you say. You&#8217;ve got more than that, but then some might say it&#8217;s hard to take you seriously when you don&#8217;t seem to be taking yourself that seriously. You told a journalist recently, &#8220;I want to be next to Joe Biden at the debate so the country can Google who&#8217;s the Asian man next to Joe Biden? And then they will discover Andrew Yang. I think that&#8217;s the ideal. I&#8217;ve done the math and I have approximately an eight percent chance of standing next to Joe Biden.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Yeah, I mean, those are just facts. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an indication of a lack of seriousness.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That&#8217;s your strategy? To get attention? To stand next to Biden?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, the reality is most Americans have no idea who&#8217;s running for president in 2020 and Joe Biden is leading because his name recognition is sky-high. And so if I can stand next to him, it would be a very useful contrast in terms of energy and ideas.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>One thing you mentioned was we can&#8217;t do the same thing again, right? You said, you know, we&#8217;re in unprecedented times. Completely agree. You know, politics is up in the air. Things are upside down. But in terms of not doing the same thing again, given the Trump experiment has been such a massive failure — I assume you think it&#8217;s been a massive failure — why do you think Americans let alone liberal Americans will want to replace him next year with another president who has zero experience of government, of elected office, of foreign policy, of international affairs?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, Donald Trump is a terrible president because he&#8217;s a terrible president but he&#8217;s not necessarily a terrible president because he hasn&#8217;t been in the public sector for decades. The American people are smart enough to distinguish between a marketing charlatan like Donald Trump not standing for everyone who has not been a senator or a governor over the last 20, 30 years.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>So, experience doesn&#8217;t matter, you think?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, I mean, we all have different sorts of experience that we&#8217;re bringing to bear and I would suggest that someone who&#8217;s spent years trying to create thousands of jobs and succeeding in the Midwest and the South and then is keenly aware of the challenges that the fourth Industrial Revolution is bringing on the American people. Why are we not talking about the fact that we automated away these millions of jobs and we&#8217;re about to do the same thing to the most common jobs in the economy?</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> And I do want to come back to the automation and your plan to tackle that in a moment. Just, before we get there, I just want to build up kind of, why you&#8217;re running and what the strategy is. When you say, you know, we all have different experiences, well clearly, that&#8217;s a truism. On that basis, anyone could run for president. And when you say you&#8217;ve created all these jobs that literally sounds like what Donald Trump said in 2015. That&#8217;s what Howard Schultz was saying a few months ago that I&#8217;m this businessman who&#8217;s created jobs. How is that any different, Andrew?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, again lumping me in with a marketing charlatan like Donald Trump is doing a disservice to genuine builders around the country. And I&#8217;ve had voters who came up to me hundreds, thousands in Iowa and Ohio and other states and they say to me point blank, &#8220;You are what I was hoping for when I voted for Donald Trump.&#8221; I&#8217;m already peeling off thousands of Trump supporters, independents, libertarians and conservatives as well as Democrats and progressives and that&#8217;s the coalition we need to build to beat Donald Trump in 2020.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> You mentioned you&#8217;re peeling off Trump supporters. One of the ways you&#8217;ve become known and gotten all these donations that you mentioned and gotten onto the debate stage against the odds is thanks to your amazing online presence. You&#8217;ve got all these funny memes. You appeared on The Joe Rogan podcast. You also went on Tucker Carlson&#8217;s Fox News show. You built this Yang Gang of online activists, but that&#8217;s come with some cost too, hasn&#8217;t it? You&#8217;ve also attracted support from alt-right trolls on Reddit, on 4chan, on some of these darker corners of the web. Do you regret the way you&#8217;ve run your campaign because it&#8217;s attracted some of these weirdos and racists?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Again, Americans are smart enough to distinguish between a candidate and a campaign and the fact that people who have completely different agendas and ideologies might end up supporting that campaign. I&#8217;ve already disavowed as you know, any sort of support from those types of people.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yes.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>I&#8217;m the son of immigrants myself and I want nothing to do with it and Americans are smart enough to see that and know that.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> I know, I get that you definitely have disavowed it and if you hadn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t have you on the show, but what I&#8217;m more wondering is why are they supporting you? Have you stopped to think what have I said or done perhaps that&#8217;s attracted these people that I need to think about again? Is the way I talk about white demographics or white birth rates or the opioids? Why is it that Richard Spencer, the neo-Nazi white supremacist says &#8220;Andrew Yang sees the problem for what it is. Everyone should take this man and his ideas seriously?&#8221; Surely that must bother you, that one of the country&#8217;s most prominent neo-Nazis is basically endorsing you. I get it that you don&#8217;t support him. I&#8217;m just wondering why you think he supports you.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>You know, when I travel in the Midwest, you know, I was with a truck driver in Iowa and he said to me. He said I don&#8217;t think the Democrats care about people like me. And I was shocked by that because growing up, the Democrats to me were the party of the working class. And so, if there are people that think that their problems have gone unaddressed and unacknowledged by our government, by the Democratic party in particular, they&#8217;ve been casting about for some sort of real response. They landed on Donald Trump. Some of them regret it. They&#8217;re looking around for real solutions and for better or for worse, I seem to be the only person who&#8217;s talking about the real problems and real solutions.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> I get that. A lot of the Democrats have been saying similar things since 2016. I&#8217;m just wondering a truck driver in Iowa is not a prominent neo-Nazi.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering what it is that attracts neo-Nazis to your campaign. You&#8217;re a progressive Democrat.</p>\n<p><b>Andrew Yang: </b>You know, and this — I believe that the problem that the truck driver is facing and the problem that the neo-Nazi is facing, it&#8217;s a disintegrating way of life. I mean, like obviously, their vision of the future is nothing we want.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Sorry, a neo-Nazi&#8217;s way of life is disintegrating? What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, you know, they look up and this is obviously, this is just me projecting because I don&#8217;t know what the heck goes through other peoples’ minds. But if they looked up and say &#8220;Hey, Donald Trump&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; and they&#8217;re like &#8220;Woah, wait, Donald Trump&#8217;s not necessarily the answer because my way of life is still —&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> Well, hold on, he might be the answer to neo-Nazis because he&#8217;s a white nationalist. The problem here, Andrew, is that they&#8217;re racists. Isn&#8217;t it easier for you to say &#8220;Look, I want to support the economic interests of white working class people, but I want to disavow the racism here&#8221;? That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m hearing from you that neo-Nazis are racist and fascists. That&#8217;s why I asked you about Richard Spencer when a racist, fascist says he likes you, I would just wonder — As you say, you&#8217;re not even a white guy. What is it about you that&#8217;s attracting a racist fascist?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> So, as you suggest, I have 100 percent disavowed anyone with any sort of racist or fascist ideology, and I&#8217;m imagining that they are actually linking the economic interest of the white working class to their ideology, but that&#8217;s just my imagining because I can&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Let&#8217;s talk about your signature policy proposal in terms of the economy because you say that all these jobs are going through automation, more jobs are going to go. You&#8217;re very worried about kind of, the robots taking our jobs. We can have a whole debate about that, which we don&#8217;t have time for. But I do want to talk about your solution to it. You&#8217;ve come up with this proposal which is known globally as the universal basic income. You&#8217;ve branded as the freedom dividend because of course, who in America doesn&#8217;t like freedom? What is it? And why is it so radical? Explain it to our listeners.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Universal basic income is a policy where every member of a society, let&#8217;s say every citizen, receives a certain amount of money. In my case, a thousand dollars a month to meet his or her basic needs. But universal basic income is not my idea. It&#8217;s not a new idea. It&#8217;s actually been with America since Thomas Paine and the founding days of the country. Martin Luther King championed it. Milton Friedman championed it. And one state in America has had a dividend for almost 40 years where everyone in Alaska gets between one and two thousand dollars a year.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yes.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>No questions asked. So, this is not a new idea. It&#8217;s not that dramatic. It actually passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971 under Richard Nixon and a thousand economists signed on to it.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yeah, and even Hillary Clinton was saying after the election that she was tempted by it but wasn&#8217;t sure how it work, how should pay for it. You want to offer $1,000 a month. No strings attached. No questions asked to American citizens, I believe age 18 to 64, am I right?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> It&#8217;s actually now 18 till expiration.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Okay, 18 till expiration, but $1,000 a month while great, isn&#8217;t going to free people from the need to work, isn&#8217;t going to end poverty. It&#8217;s not enough to live on and isn&#8217;t that the problem with a universal basic income, why it hasn&#8217;t been tried by more countries? Because if it&#8217;s affordable, it&#8217;s not enough and to make it enough, it becomes unaffordable. That&#8217;s the paradox, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, I love that you have already put into bed this myth that it&#8217;s unaffordable. That makes me very happy. But $12,000 per adult, if you have two adults in the household be $24,000 a year, which ends up being a game changer for millions of American households. It puts people in a much different situation and a $1,000 a month goes much further in the Midwest and the South than it does in DC or New York, you know —</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> It also goes much further depending on the status of your household, $24,000 for two people living together without kids is great. But $12,000 for one single mother with four kids isn&#8217;t so great.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, the wonderful thing for that single mother is they can look at each of their kids and say when you turn 18, you&#8217;re going to get a thousand dollars a month because your country loves you, your country values you.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> Okay, but that&#8217;s not going to help them while their kids are four, five, six, seven. Come on, Andrew.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>As a parent myself that would be a game-changer because we&#8217;re all always concerned about saving for our kids.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> No, people who are concerned about saving for their kids are the ones who could afford to. The people who are trying to put food on the table and live day to day are not going to be happy about the fact that President Yang is giving them a $1,000 a month and then giving their neighbors who have no kids $24,000 a month.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, it&#8217;s not meant to replace existing social programs under —</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> I thought it was. I thought you were going to pay for it by cutting existing social programs.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> No, if you were a single mother of four and you&#8217;re receiving in excess of $1,000 in benefits then that would be completely untouched as it should be.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>So, how are you going to pay for this? To ask the famous question of conservatives.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, the way you pay for it is by paying attention to who&#8217;s winning in this economy. How is Amazon, a trillion dollar tech company paying zero in federal taxes less than you or me? And so, of course you can&#8217;t pay for it if your biggest winners from the technology revolution are paying zero into the system. So, the United States has to join every other advanced economy and have a value-added tax, which would then give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon transaction, every Google search.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> Hold on, isn&#8217;t this a bit like Trump and tariffs? He says Mexico&#8217;s going to pay for the tariffs. Amazon&#8217;s not going to pay the value added tax. I&#8217;m from the UK. We have a VAT, a value-added tax. It&#8217;s a consumption tax, a sales tax. The consumers are going to pay that tax. It&#8217;s going to add onto the prices of what they buy.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well again, you have to look at it and say how is the Amazon paying zero in taxes? And you while you can say like Amazon —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That&#8217;s by avoiding corporation tax.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>There is absolutely nothing that says —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>By running things through Ireland. It&#8217;s got nothing to do with VAT.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> — That says a company has to pass along 100 percent of the VAT to its consumers while some businesses do that, some businesses do not.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> But many do and you said on the Ezra Klein Show, I was listening to your appearance on Vox&#8217;s Ezra Klein show. You said that Ivanka Trump will end up paying more in a sales tax than a poorer person, than the average Joe and that&#8217;s true in absolute terms. But you know in proportional terms, that&#8217;s not true at all. Every economist will tell you, Andrew, that a sales tax is regressive. They hit the poor much harder than the rich because the rich can afford to save a lot more whereas the poor tend to consume a lot more.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Yeah, that would be 100 percent true in a vacuum. But in this instance, we&#8217;re taking every dollar from the value added tax plus an additional two dollars and putting it directly into people&#8217;s hands which would increase the buying power of approximately the bottom 94 percent of Americans.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Why do that with a regressive tax? You&#8217;re a Democrat. Why not do it with a progressive tax? Why not raise income tax on Jeff Bezos? Why not do a wealth tax like Elizabeth Warren&#8217;s brought in? Why do a regressive tax?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> I would be for making our tax code more progressive too. This is not an either or situation, but you have to go where the money is and if you look at someone —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>You&#8217;re not proposing it. You&#8217;re proposing a sales tax.</p>\n<p><b>AY: — </b>Someone like Jeff Bezos who is now worth, post-divorce something like 120 billion dollars, he doesn&#8217;t have taxable events because most of that wealth is tied up in Amazon stock. And so, you need to go where the money is. The money is going into his business.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>You don&#8217;t support Senator Warren&#8217;s wealth tax?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, I understand the spirit of it. I think there&#8217;s a lot of wisdom to what she&#8217;s trying to do. But I also know a lot of wealthy people and I think implementation will be very, very difficult because most of the wealthy people I know would not be above sequestering wealth in various offshore havens and making it very, very hard for the government to get a proper inventory on what that wealth is.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t get, Andrew, on the one hand, and I want to come to some of your other policies, as well, but you do just kind of, jump from extremes. On the one hand, you want to for example, you say in your book you want to jail the CEO and largest shareholder of any company that&#8217;s either fined by the federal government or bailed out by the federal government, which would basically mean imprisoning Warren Buffett and maybe Mark Zuckerberg too which might be popular with a lot of Americans but on the other hand, when Senator Warren says, let&#8217;s break up Amazon. Let&#8217;s break up Facebook, a much milder proposal compared to yours. You&#8217;re opposed to that. I kind of don&#8217;t get it.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>I&#8217;m not opposed to breaking up Facebook and Amazon. What I&#8217;m opposed to is emotional responses that might not solve the problem. If you break up Amazon into four mini Amazons, that might feel good. But what does that do for the average Main Street economy in Iowa, Ohio? Virtually nothing. So, what are you really trying to solve for here? We&#8217;re in the 21st century and trying to have 20th century economic dynamics of competition may not make sense in some of these situations. No one wants to use the fourth best navigation app. No one wants to Bing anything. You know, it&#8217;s like, trying to introduce competition into some of these marketplaces may not make any sense.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>No, I&#8217;m with you on avoiding emotional responses, but you don&#8217;t think locking up Warren Buffett for a month because Wells Fargo where he&#8217;s a majority shareholder or the bigger shareholder, took a 20 or 25 billion dollar bailout, you don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an emotional response?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> I don&#8217;t because at this point if you&#8217;re a rational corporation, you are better served by abusing the public trust and paying the occasional fine than you are being truly, you know, restrained about your behavior. It&#8217;s just the incentives. You have to make incentives that would actually work for people.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> So President Andrew Yang would put Warren Buffett in prison for a month?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, that&#8217;s the great thing about this because right now you have to ask yourself who&#8217;s running America? Is it us, the American people? Is it our democracy? Is it our government leaders? Or is it our corporations and rich shareholders running amok? I think most Americans know what the answer is.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> I get that and you&#8217;re preaching to the converted. I&#8217;m with you on the oligarchy. I&#8217;m to the left of Bernie on the economy. I&#8217;m just asking would President Andrew Young really want to put someone like Warren Buffett in prison as part of that strategy?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, and that&#8217;s the wonderful thing about it is that you&#8217;re not necessarily forced to put Warren Buffett in prison. You know, it&#8217;s like you do have some discretion. You can look at it and say hey like, you know, jailing grampa&#8217;s not a good move.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>But you wouldn&#8217;t be opposed to doing it?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> But you know, but in other instances like the CEOs of Purdue Pharma, 100 percent those people should have gone to jail.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Some of the other outsider candidates, you know, Peter Buttigieg, who came from nowhere, small town mayor. No one really heard of him six months ago, came on this show. We talked a lot about some of his kind of &#8220;radical&#8221; political proposals. You&#8217;ve talked about the economy, fixing a broken economy. What about the broken U.S. political system? I haven&#8217;t heard from you on abolishing the Electoral College or reforming the Supreme Court, which we hear from Buttigieg and from Elizabeth Warren and others. In fact, I think you poo-pooed the idea of abolishing the Electoral College which has the support of a big, big majority of Democrats and even a majority of all Americans.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> I&#8217;m for reforming the Electoral College. I&#8217;m for making it so that Americans, candidates have to compete in every state and not just the eight swing states. But I think abolishing the Electoral College entirely would focus campaign efforts on highly dense, highly populated urban areas and big media markets and that would be a very consistent bias in our elections.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>There&#8217;s already a bias. There&#8217;s already a massive undemocratic bias in the system. You have two Republicans elected in the space of 16 years without winning the popular vote. How is that Democratic?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Yeah, and so, this to me is one of the fundamental questions, Mehdi, is that if you&#8217;re losing elections by rules that are engraved in our Constitution and then, you say, you know what we need to do? We need to change the rules. Like what that&#8217;s suggesting is that you can&#8217;t win by the rules that have been agreed on and so you&#8217;ve given up trying and you say you know, I need new rules.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>— The rules we agreed on over 200 years ago and we&#8217;ve moved on.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>And certainly if there was a genuine consensus among our people that that&#8217;s the case —</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> There is, a majority of Americans including Republicans support abolishing the Electoral College.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>But we know that it would be a non-starter to actually get that passed because it would require a super majority in both Houses of Congress or a super majority of States, half of which would be shooting themselves in the foot in terms of their own electoral clout. So, we know it&#8217;s a loser. Instead of focusing on things we know we cannot do, let&#8217;s solve some problems.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> I mean, I thought you were Andrew Yang, the outside-the-box guy. You&#8217;re kind of, pooh-poohing, accepting defeat before you&#8217;ve even kind of started the battle.</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> Well, on this one again, you know, like, I&#8217;m a rational person. I am for expanding the Supreme Court. There&#8217;s nothing in the Constitution that talks about —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>You&#8217;re a rational person? Are you saying Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are irrational for suggesting abolishing the Electoral College?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>On that particular point, I think they come across as hyper-partisan and sore losers. Like if we can&#8217;t win by the rules, like the first thing we need to do is win by the rules and then we can change the rules. Let&#8217;s win a couple of elections and then we can try and amend the Electoral College.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>I mean Barack Obama won two elections. You say you want to reform the Electoral College. How would you reform it then to make it fairer?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> So, what we need to do is we need to make it so that it&#8217;s not a winner-take-all on a state-by-state basis. So, if you had proportional allocation of electors, then someone like me would still want to campaign in Texas because if I carve out some percentage of the vote, then I actually get electoral votes and then it opens up the entire country. That&#8217;s a much more reasonable fix that everyone can get on board with than getting rid of the Electoral College entirely.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> When Hillary Clinton ran against Barack Obama in 2008, she ran on her experience. She tried to make out that he was inexperienced. It didn&#8217;t work. But one of the famous campaign ads from that time was you know, what will Barack Obama do if there&#8217;s a phone call at 3 a.m.? Contrasting her own experience as a senator, as a former first lady with his you know, lack of experience in foreign policy. A lot of people would look at someone like yourself again, looking at Trump — he&#8217;s in the UK right now making a fool of himself — and say do we want another inexperienced president when it comes to the global stage, national security, thorny foreign policy problems? What do you say to them?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, what I&#8217;d say to them is that there is no prior experience that can truly prepare you for the incredible responsibility of being commander-in-chief, but what I can convey is the principles that I would bring to the office. I&#8217;ve already signed a pledge to end the forever wars. I think that the United States needs to put the power to declare military intervention back in the hands of Congress where it belongs, in the Constitution and where it has not been for unfortunately almost two decades, that we need to be more realistic about what we can and can&#8217;t accomplish internationally, and we need to be more judicious and restrained. And that is the way I would pick up that 3 a.m. phone call. That&#8217;s the way I would approach all of these foreign policy issues.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>And I think those are great principles, let me just say. That&#8217;s all music to my ears. But in terms of the actual dealing with the issues, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re in the White House, January 2021. You&#8217;ve just become president. You get the 3 a.m. call from your joint chief saying that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched airstrikes in what he says is a Pakistani terrorist training camp and the Pakistanis are threatening to launch nuclear missiles in response. What do you do?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Well, the first thing I do is I sit down with my joint chiefs of staff. I get all the information about the situation and then they lay out, I&#8217;m sure, like an array of appropriate responses and then I confer with the people who are closest to the situation and people whose judgment that I trust and then I make a decision. And the American people will have confidence that I&#8217;ve made the best decision based on the information that I have.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>It&#8217;s day one of your presidency, prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu decides to test the new progressive Democratic President Andrew Yang. He says Israel is annexing the occupied West Bank. What&#8217;s your response?</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>I mean, Israel and the West Bank, It&#8217;s been an historic morass. And so I don&#8217;t have any quick answers or solutions. But clearly that would be against the principles that have been in place in terms of trying to reach a solution that — In my mind, the two-state solution be ideal and that would be against my vision for the region.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>So, what would you do? Would you punish it? Would you put in sanctions? Would you make U.S. military aid conditional, as Peter Beinart and others have suggested, Bernie Sanders has suggested?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> You know, we have a very distinct relationship with Israel. Like if that happened, I would sit down with the right people in my administration and determine the appropriate response.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Andrew, a lot of people at home listening to this,  especially on the left might say this Andrew Yang guy&#8217;s very interesting. I like what he says about Amazon. I like what he says about restraint in foreign policy, but I just don&#8217;t get why he doesn&#8217;t run for the House, for the Senate. Why doesn&#8217;t he start at the right level and be a really good governor or senator or mayor or member of the House? Why run for president? What is it? Is it ego? Is it ambition? What is it that&#8217;s motivating you to go right for the top job right at the start?</p>\n<p><b>AY:</b> It&#8217;s my certainty that the problems that got Donald Trump into office are not being addressed by our leaders and they&#8217;re just going to accelerate as 40% percent, 30 percent of malls close in the next four years, artificial intelligence starts displacing call center workers, and when the robot trucks hit the highways and 5 to 10 years, it&#8217;s going to be an epic disaster for hundreds of thousands of Americans in hundreds of communities around the country. I&#8217;m running for president because we do not have that much time and I actually have like zero ego about this. I&#8217;m on the record saying if someone else were to come into office and solve these problems, I would be thrilled. I&#8217;ve got two young boys who I never see when I&#8217;m on the road like anyone who&#8217;s doing this for ego is out of their minds. I&#8217;m doing this to solve the problem and to help lead this country in a shape I&#8217;m proud of for my children, for your children, for the next generation. That&#8217;s the only reason I&#8217;m running.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> Andrew Yang, thank you for joining me on Deconstructed.</p>\n<p><b>AY: </b>Thanks so much, Mehdi. It&#8217;s been a pleasure. </p>\n<p>[Music interlude.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That was Andrew Yang who&#8217;s running for the Democratic presidential nomination, who&#8217;s qualified for the Democratic debates, the TV debates in a few weeks time. He&#8217;s gonna be on stage in Miami maybe standing next to Joe Biden, which is key to his strategy for name recognition and raising his appeal. I&#8217;m not sure I buy his rather dystopian view of the future, this fear that robots are going to take all our jobs. We&#8217;ve had those fears before, not sure I buy it but maybe when I watch the new Terminator movie that&#8217;s out later this year, Sarah Connor&#8217;s back, maybe I&#8217;ll change my position and become more Yang-ian. For now, I&#8217;m not so sure about that.</p>\n<p>Not quite sold on a universal basic income either. Although I see the pros on his side of the argument but there are many cons. And I think for a candidate on the Democratic side who wants to disavow as he has white nationalists who seem to be flocking to him online, in weird online forums, best not to say that neo-Nazis are seeing their way of life disrupted. That was kind of concerning to hear him say that. I do hope that was a slip of the tongue. But I also worry that he&#8217;s maybe not been able to speak about race and some of the racial resentment that&#8217;s been driving Trump in perhaps the right way, but good luck to him.</p>\n<p>[Music interlude.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That’s our show! <i>Deconstructed</i> is a production of First Look Media and The Intercept.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>As vice president,</u> Joe Biden repeatedly sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate, working in alliance with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to push for a broad exemption that would have left millions of women without coverage.</p>\n<p>Biden’s battle over contraception is a window into his approach to the politics of reproductive freedom, a function of an electoral worldview that centers working-class Catholic men over the interests of women. The issue has been causing his presidential campaign some discomfort — on Wednesday, Biden’s campaign clarified that he remains a supporter of the so-called Hyde Amendment, a provision that bars federal money from being used to fund reproductive health services. Biden had recently told an activist with the American Civil Liberties Union that he opposed the amendment, and wanted to see it repealed.</p>\n<p>On contraception, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-08/obama-weighed-religious-politics-before-taking-decision-on-contraceptives">contemporaneous reporting</a> and sources involved with the internal debate, Biden had argued that if the regulations implementing the Affordable Care Act were going to mandate coverage, it would have angered white, male, Catholic voters, and threatened Barack Obama’s re-election in 2012. Biden’s main ally in the internal fight over contraception was chief of staff William Daly; both men are Catholic.</p>\n<p>Opposing Biden was a faction of mostly women advisers, joined by some men, who argued that Biden had both the policy and the politics wrong. On policy, they noted that if his broad exemption went into effect, upwards of 6 million women who happened to be employed by religious-affiliated organizations would lose contraception coverage. The politics were just as bad, they argued, given that women were increasingly becoming central to the party’s success. To turn on them on the issue of access to birth control — embracing a fringe position not even adopted by most Catholics who aren’t bishops — would put that support at risk.</p>\n<p>Biden has long said that he is personally opposed to abortion, but supports the legal right. His support of Roe v. Wade has not always been full-throated.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to issues like abortion, amnesty, and acid, I’m about as liberal as your grandmother,” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-abortion-1974_n_560c5ee3e4b076812700b4d6">Biden said in a June 1974 article.</a> “I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.”</p>\n<p>Because Biden’s anti-Roe comments came so long ago — more than four decades — some have argued they are of little value in gauging his current politics. But his battle against contraception, and his unwillingness to join the bulk of the Democratic field and call for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, puts him dramatically out of step with today’s party.</p>\n<p>Biden is so out of step, in fact, that when he was shown polling data during the contraception fight, he dismissed it as inaccurate. He has a view of the American electorate’s politics on abortion that can’t be influenced by new facts. Jake Tapper, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/policy-and-politics-of-contraception-rule-fiercely-debated-within-white-house/#.TzR5kgDpy50.twitter">then reporting for ABC News</a>, reported in February 2012:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The two sides couldn&#8217;t even agree about what they were debating. In the fall, [Planned Parenthood head Cecile] Richards brought in polling indicating that the American people overwhelmingly supported the birth control benefit in health insurance. She also highlighted statistics showing the overwhelming use of birth control.</p>\n<p>The Vice President and others argued that this wouldn&#8217;t be seen as an issue of contraception — it would be seen as an issue of religious liberty. They questioned the polling of the rule advocates, arguing that it didn&#8217;t explain the issue in full, it ignored the question of what religious groups should have to pay for. And they argued that women voters for whom this was an important issue weren&#8217;t likely to vote for Mitt Romney, who has drawn a strong anti-abortion line as a presidential candidate, saying he would end federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/dems-attack-romney-on-abortion-personhood/">supporting a &#8220;personhood&#8221; amendment</a> that defines life as beginning at the moment of fertilization.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Mike Dorning and Margaret Talev <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-08/obama-weighed-religious-politics-before-taking-decision-on-contraceptives">reported</a>, &#8220;Vice President Joe Biden and then-White House chief of staff Bill Daley, also Catholics, warned that the mandate would be seen as a government intrusion on religious institutions. Even moderate Catholic voters in battleground states might be alienated, they warned, according to the people familiar with the discussions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was ultimately public anger that led to Biden and Daley’s defeat on the issue. On January 31, 2012, as the administration was finalizing its policy, it was reported that Susan G. Komen for the Cure <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/komen-planned-parenthood-cuts-karen-handel_n_1245568">had cut its funding of Planned Parenthood,</a> in a push led by abortion foe Karen Handel. The fury over the decision stunned the organization, which backtracked and apologized within a week, as Planned Parenthood raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from angered supporters of abortion rights. “We want to apologize to the American public for recent decisions that cast doubt upon our commitment to our mission of saving women’s lives,” Komen said in a statement on February 3, 2012.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The White House watched the affair unfold closely, and the blowback punctured the mythology that there is no real public support for abortion rights. It also sent a signal that if the White House backtracked on access to contraception, it could expect a livid response. The exemption that was ultimately granted, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/02/10/president-obama-announces-new-policy-improve-access-contraception">on February 10</a>, was a very narrow one, frustrating the bishops.</p>\n<p>In his vice presidential debate with Mitt Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, Biden attempted to portray it as a broad exemption. &#8220;No religious institution — Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic social services, Georgetown hospital, Mercy hospital, any hospital — none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact,&#8221; Biden said in the debate.</p>\n<p>In a rare public disagreement with Biden, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops shot back with a statement, accurately saying that Biden’s claim was “<a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/catholic-bishops-rebuke-biden-over-contraception-mandate-claims">not a fact</a>.” Indeed, many religious-affiliated entities that had hoped to win an exemption, and which had Biden’s support inside the White House, had failed. But with Biden now a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president, they may get another shot at denying access to contraception to their employees.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/05/joe-biden-worked-to-undermine-the-affordable-care-acts-coverage-of-contraception/">Joe Biden Worked to Undermine the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s Coverage of Contraception</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Republicans in North</u> Carolina are playing with a legislator’s life over a controversial anti-abortion measure.</p>\n<p>The North Carolina <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2019/S359">bill</a> — which closely resembles the national “born-alive” bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/311/text">introduced</a> by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., in January — would introduce criminal penalties against doctors who don’t care for babies that survive abortions.</p>\n<p>Democrats in the state legislature have been showing up every day in case Republicans put the measure to a vote, so that they’ll have the numbers to sustain a veto. One of the state representatives making daily appearances is Democratic state Rep. Sydney Batch of Wake County. She has breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in early May. Instead of taking three weeks off to recover, she’s been making her way to the statehouse every day to be present to vote.</p>\n<p><div class=\'img-wrap align-right  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 683px;\'>\n<img class="alignright size-large wp-image-253235" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/High-1559754416-683x1024.jpg" alt="High-1559754416" /></p>\n<p class="caption">Rep. Sydney Batch.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo: Courtesy of Rep. Batch</p></div>“I wish it wouldn’t have to be the case,” Batch told The Intercept. “I did not want this to be a story locally or nationally. I had no idea that it would turn into what it is.”</p>\n<p>North Carolina Republicans passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act through the House and Senate in April, and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper <a href="https://webservices.ncleg.net/ViewBillDocument/2019/3682/0/S359-BD-NBC-5748">vetoed</a> it on April 18. The Senate overrode the veto on April 30, and the House placed it back on the calendar soon after to try to do the same. But they’ve been playing a cat-and-mouse game: House Republicans have placed the measure on the legislative calendar and withdrawn it at least 10 times in the month of May, removing it when enough Democrats show up and they realize they don’t have enough votes to push it through.</p>\n<p>Batch described the maneuver by Republicans as political gamesmanship and took issue with their characterization of the bill as a good-faith effort to protect children. “If it really was about women’s health, and if it really was about trying to make sure voters could be heard on this issue, then we wouldn’t be in the situation that we are now,” she said. “It really ultimately just saddens me. And I’m willing to suffer through the physical and temporary pain in order to make sure that women have that right in the future and that it’s not just because I couldn’t get in that day to vote.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>&#8220;I’m willing to suffer through the physical and temporary pain in order to make sure that women have that right in the future.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>Batch pointed out the irony in the fact that she’s sacrificing her own health in order to keep the legislature from passing a measure that would further erode the quality of women’s health care in her state. “We could have just held off for two weeks,” Batch said. “I wasn’t even asking for more than two weeks, honestly. I didn’t actually ask for any time,” she explained. “I could have recovered and come back.”</p>\n<p>In response to questions from The Intercept, a spokesperson for Republican North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore said, &#8220;The scheduling procedure of the Born Alive bill’s veto override on the calendar is the same scheduling procedure the North Carolina House has used for veto overrides in all three of Speaker Moore’s terms and in terms before his — it’s not unique to this issue or legislative session.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In November, Democrats were able to break the supermajority Republicans had held in both of North Carolina’s legislative chambers since 2011, meaning that Republicans no longer have the three-fifths majority they need to override a veto by Cooper.</p>\n<p>The latest calendar date for the veto override vote is Wednesday — so Batch will once again make her way to the legislature to ensure that she’s there in case the vote takes place. She said, “I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if for some reason we didn’t sustain the governor’s veto by one vote, and it was simply because I wasn’t able to get in.”</p>\n<p><u>The &#8220;born-alive&#8221; bill</u> is part of a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/23/abortion-womens-health-protection-act/">national effort</a> to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/28/abortion-laws-reproductive-rights/">curtail women’s rights</a> to certain types of reproductive care, Batch said. After Alabama passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, similar legislation quickly popped up in states across the country. At least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/16/politics/states-abortion-laws/index.html">seven other states</a> have already passed similar laws this year.</p>\n<p>What’s happening in North Carolina, Batch explained, is a response to a nationwide push by the Republican Party to introduce state-level legislation to walk back abortion rights and advance a divisive political narrative that doesn’t necessarily reflect voter preferences. Four out of five Alabamians <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/28/alabama-state-legislators-are-wrong-about-their-voters-opinions-abortion/?utm_term=.dd1c61eda682">oppose</a> the latest law, and a 2018 <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-support-roe-v-wade-hits-new-high-n893806">poll</a> from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal showed that 71 percent of voters support Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion access.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s an extremely well-coordinated effort by some groups, whoever they are, through the Republican Houses and members, using Republicans as conduits in order to get this legislation passed,” Batch said. “We’ve seen it rolled out nationally in almost every other state as a narrative that I think is trying to just cause and sow division among parties and individuals. Rather than really deal with the fact that if we actually worked on legislation to help women, to help families, then we could work together and change lots of people’s lives,” she said.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The North Carolina legislature is already known for advancing extremely conservative measures, including the notorious 2016 “<a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68401147.html">bathroom bill</a>” that would have forced transgender people to use the bathroom for the gender they were assigned at birth. A federal court in 2016 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/us/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolina-voter-id-provision.html?module=inline">struck down</a> a discriminatory North Carolina voter ID law that judges said “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.” Legislators admitted in court filings that parts of their proposed changes were intended to partially suppress the black vote. Earlier this year, Republicans in the legislature <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/04/north-carolina-sheriffs-ice-cooperation/">introduced a bill</a> — opposed by the North Carolina Sheriff’s Association — that would force sheriffs to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after five newly elected sheriffs announced that they would be changing the way their offices work with federal immigration officers.</p>\n<p>As for the state’s &#8220;born-alive&#8221; measure, North Carolina already has legislation outlining doctors’ responsibilities and duties. And there are already laws in North Carolina that criminalize neglecting or killing children. “Even on the floor debate the day we voted on it in the House, one of the Republican representatives said in her speech that there was a doctor serving time for doing this — which means that there are laws currently in place to actually address this issue,&#8221; said Batch.</p>\n<p>There’s only been one such recent case where a doctor did not provide lifesaving medical care to an infant that survived an abortion. As the Republican representative mentioned, that doctor is already in jail.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>“No one likes infanticide, no one wants babies to die. But this is not a bill that addresses that issue.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>Republicans aren’t pushing the bill in good faith, Batch explained. “No one likes infanticide, no one wants babies to die,” she said. “No one wants medical treatment to be able to be withheld from them. But this is not a bill that addresses that issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The spokesperson for Moore, the Republican state House speaker, said, &#8220;The Born Alive bill creates a unique duty of care for abortion survivors not currently in state law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Batch said the bill “also disregards a lot of women who end up having children with congenital defects, and women who may be in a position in which they have to give birth to a stillborn or to a baby who will suffer and die shortly after birth.” She continued, “This bill is going to prevent some women from being able to talk to their doctors about exactly what can happen.”</p>\n<p>Batch said her colleagues in the legislature have been supportive and that one of her fellow Republican representatives even offered not to vote so she wouldn’t have to come in and forgo cancer treatment. But she hasn’t heard from Moore, the House speaker, she said.</p>\n<p>“There are more important things in North Carolina that we need to be addressing, and in the United States, than hot-button topics that are not as divisive as polls indicate,” she said. “If we’re at 70 percent margins that Roe v. Wade should be left alone, then why don’t we talk about the other issues? Like the fact that there are people out here that don’t have health insurance or access to medical treatment, or can’t take time off when they do get sick because they’ll lose their jobs?” Batch introduced her own family leave bill this session that would address some of those very issues. “It’ll never see the light of day,” she said. “Ever.”</p>\n<p>“If we really care about people, and if we care about taking care of one another, and children, as has been the thing that they continue to beat on the other side of the aisle — Republicans — then why don’t we care about the children that are here?” she asked. “And if we start talking about things like that, then perhaps we wouldn’t need to talk about whether or not children in these particular situations are going to be hurt by doctors.”</p>\n<p><strong>Correction: June 5, 2019, 5:40 p.m.</strong><br />\n<em>An earlier version of this story cited a 2018 ABC News and Wall Street Journal public opinion poll on Roe v.

      link: 'https://theintercept.com/2019/06/05/pipeline-protests-proposed-legislation-phmsa-alec/',
      pubDate: 'Wed, 05 Jun 2019 15:10:26 +0000',
      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Legislation proposed by</u> the Trump administration would prescribe up to 20 years in prison for “inhibiting the operation” of an oil or gas pipeline — or even conspiring to do so. Since Donald Trump was inaugurated, at least 17 states have introduced bills that would criminalize participation in pipeline protests. But this is the first time the tactic has been formally proposed by the executive branch. If it were to pass, it would strike a major blow to the climate movement, putting anti-fossil fuel organizers at significant legal risk for simply providing training or logistical support to peaceful protesters.</p>\n<p>The criminal penalties are part of a <a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/protecting-our-infrastructure-pipelines-and-enhancing-safety-act-2019-section-section-analysis">proposal</a> to reauthorize pipeline safety programs at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The proposal, which Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao delivered to Congress on Monday, echoes language from a <a href="https://www.alec.org/model-policy/critical-infrastructure-protection-act/">model bill</a> promoted by the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council, whose members include legislators and oil industry lobbyists. <a href="http://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/">Eight</a> state legislatures have passed laws similar to the ALEC model.</p>\n<p>Activists fighting fossil fuel extraction have long been the most confrontational arm of the U.S. climate movement, with participants routinely standing in the way of pipeline construction. Thousands of people showed up to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in its effort to stop construction of the Dakota Access pipeline over concerns that pipeline leaks would harm the reservation’s primary source of drinking water.</p>\n<p>From the early days of his presidency, Trump made a point to tip the scales in favor of highly controversial oil and gas pipelines; one of his first executive orders was designed to expedite DAPL construction and lift a halt imposed by former President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>But it’s another pipeline fight that stands to be most impacted by the proposed federal legislation. The Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline launched the U.S. pipeline opposition movement back in 2011, and it still has yet to be built. Trump has issued multiple executive orders to push it forward, but it remains mired in legal challenges. If it begins construction, opponents, many from the same Indigenous nations as the anti-DAPL organizers, have promised another Standing Rock.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, with the pipeline industry booming, communities are organizing against numerous projects across the United States. In Louisiana, for example, multiple people were arrested under the state’s ALEC-inspired law while protesting construction of the Bayou Bridge oil pipeline.</p>\n<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/23/pipeline-protest-laws-louisiana-south-dakota/">challenging</a> the Louisiana law on First Amendment grounds. Pam Spees, the attorney representing pipeline opponents in the case, said the goal of the Trump administration’s proposal is clear. “We already know from the way similar legislation has been applied in Louisiana what the true aim of this bill is to chill and eliminate opposition to these projects.”</p>\n<h3>The Pipes Act</h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/60123">Current federal law</a> protecting oil and gas pipelines from sabotage is already strong. Anyone who damages or destroys a pipeline or pipeline facility — or conspires to do so — faces up to 20 years of incarceration. If the sabotage causes a death, then the saboteur could face life in prison or even the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration is seeking to widen the law’s scope even further. Under the proposed <a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/protecting-our-infrastructure-pipelines-and-enhancing-safety-act-2019-section-section-analysis">Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2019</a>, known as the Pipes Act, anyone found “vandalizing, tampering with, impeding the operation of, disrupting the operation of, or inhibiting the operation of” an interstate oil or gas pipeline could also face a 20-year prison term, as could anyone who conspired to do so. And the proposal would add pipeline construction sites to the list of facilities covered by the law.</p>\n<p>In effect, simply standing in the way of construction workers could mean staring down two decades in prison.</p>\n<p>The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which proposed the legislation, denies that chilling speech is the intention. “This proposal is not meant in any way to inhibit lawful protesters from exercising their First Amendment rights, and PHMSA is committed to working with Congress to make sure that this is clear in any final legislation,” agency spokesperson Darius Kirkwood told The Intercept. “PHMSA supports broadening statutes to deter individuals from activities that can cause serious harm.”</p>\n<p>Kirkwood said the agency has significant safety concerns and pointed to a case in Minnesota, which is in the midst of a debate over the proposed expansion of the Enbridge Line 3 pipeline. In February, four pipeline opponents associated with the Catholic Worker movement turned aboveground valves on the Line 3 and Line 4 oil pipelines. The activists said they contacted Enbridge in advance, however, allowing the company to <a href="https://grist.org/article/valve-turners-try-to-shut-off-minnesota-pipelines-say-politicians-wont-act/">shut off</a> the pipelines remotely. The valve turners <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/4566532-four-pipeline-activists-arrested-itasca-county">said</a> they took action “in solidarity with the most vulnerable worldwide who suffer the greatest impact from climate change.” They were charged with felonies that carry a maximum of five years in prison and $11,000 in fines.</p>\n<p>As another example of the agency’s safety concerns, Kirkwood pointed to an <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/09/2016-29500/pipeline-safety-safeguarding-and-securing-pipelines-from-unauthorized-access">advisory bulletin</a> PHMSA released to pipeline owners and operators in December 2016, which describes another incident in which activists turned valves to shut off oil pipelines. The bulletin reveals that the draft legislation isn&#8217;t the first time that the agency has pushed for enhanced policing of pipeline opponents. “A strong relationship with local law enforcement is extremely beneficial for safe pipeline operations,” the notice stated. “Relationships should be cultivated well in advance of an incident to facilitate mutually dependable communication during an incident.”</p>\n<p>The bulletin encouraged pipeline owners to increase the frequency of security patrols, which “may help inform pipeline companies of individuals who regularly congregate near a pipeline.” It also encouraged operators to “consider the use of new technologies to aid in pipeline security patrols, such as unmanned aerial systems,” also known as drones.</p>\n<h3>The Price of Protest</h3>\n<p>As the crackdown on pipeline protest goes federal, states continue to be a laboratory for new and creative ways to deter protest.</p>\n<p>In at least two states, a new model of anti-pipeline protest law is evolving, designed to transfer the costs of policing demonstrations to the protesters. In March, South Dakota passed a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/23/pipeline-protest-laws-louisiana-south-dakota/">law</a> that creates new financial penalties for “riot-boosting,” which will be deposited into a fund for law enforcement and emergency management. And a <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2019&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=S&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0323&amp;pn=0300">bill</a> under consideration in Pennsylvania would hold any demonstrator convicted of a felony or misdemeanor accountable for the costs of policing the demonstration. The bill, which cites the public cost of managing the Dakota Access pipeline protests, defines “demonstration” as including “the holding of vigils or religious services.”</p>\n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit challenging the riot-boosting law in South Dakota on the basis that it’s unconstitutionally broad and violates First Amendment speech rights. The Oglala Sioux tribal council banned Gov. Kristi Noem from the reservation in response to the legislation.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>Grassroots organizers in multiple states have also been rising up. On Friday, dozens of community members in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, demonstrated outside the office of state Sen. Scott Martin, who has sponsored multiple anti-protest bills. They’ve launched a “Keep Free Speech Free” <a href="https://keepfreespeechfree.com/">website</a> and plan to run a candidate against Martin in the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>“We have every intention of making him as vulnerable as possible,” said Mark Clatterbuck, whose property was in the path of the Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline, according to early construction plans. That pipeline was completed last fall, despite demonstrations and legal challenges. But Pennsylvania is one of the centers of America’s fracking boom, and organizers are determined to defeat anti-protest legislation in anticipation of future fights. “It’s only a matter of time,” Clatterbuck said.</p>\n<p>Of course, if the Trump administration proposal were to become law, it would supersede any gains made locally by the Lancaster organizers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/05/pipeline-protests-proposed-legislation-phmsa-alec/">Trump Administration Asks Congress to Make Disrupting Pipeline Construction a Crime Punishable by 20 Years in Prison</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. &#x2014; It&#x2019;s half past noon on a recent Tuesday at the Silicon Valley office of health-tech startup Livongo, and a U.S. map projected on a screen is flashing with pins that pop up and then disappear like fireworks. Each of the 5,000 pins marks the spot where a diabetes patient in Livongo&#x2019;s program has just beamed in a new blood glucose reading. Most of the pins are green, meaning that the patient&#x2019;s blood sugar is at a safe level, but some are blue, denoting a level too low, or red, for too high.</p>\n<p>These days, Livongo is processing more than 100,000 such readings daily &#x2014; a sign of the chronic disease-coaching company&#x2019;s rapid growth ahead of an expected initial public offering sometime this year. It&#x2019;s likely to be among the first of a new breed of health-tech startups to brave the public markets.</p><p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/10/livongo-diabetes-coaching-startup-expected-ipo/?utm_campaign=rss">Continue to STAT Plus to read the full story&hellip;</a></p>',
