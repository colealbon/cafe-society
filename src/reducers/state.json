      'content:encoded': '<p>Last Sunday, the Intercept and the Intercept Brasil <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-archive-operation-car-wash/">published a series of exposés</a> that has created a major political earthquake in Brazil that has only grown and intensified throughout the week. In less than a week, the once-revered Justice Minister of President Bolsonaro&#8217;s government, Sergio Moro, now faces widespread calls to resign from the same large Brazilian media outlets that spent years transforming him into an untouchable icon of integrity and uncritically applauding his every move.</p>\n<p>Even more grave, the improprieties revealed by our reporting have cast serious doubt on the validity of numerous guilty verdicts issued by Judge Moro and the anti-corruption task force, beginning &#8211; most importantly &#8211; with the conviction and imprisonment of former President Lula da Silva last year at exactly the time that he was the overwhelming front-runner to win the presidency in 2018. That conviction by Judge Moro, which we now know was the by-product of highly improper and unethical conduct, is now scheduled to be reviewed by the Supreme Court as early as next week.</p>\n<p>The archive we received from our source is vast, and contains many more explosive stories yet to be reported. Just last night, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/sergio-moro-enquanto-julgava-lula-sugeriu-a-lava-jato-emitir-uma-nota-oficial-contra-a-defesa-eles-acataram-e-pautaram-a-imprensa/">we published another story</a> exposing even more serious improprieties by Judge Moro, widely regarded as the anchor of legitimacy for the Bolsonaro government, that has led for more calls for him to resign. Because of the importance but also complexity of these issues for those outside of Brazil, we created a video explaining what this archive is about, what these revelations mean, and why the consequences of our reporting are so significant not only for Brazil but for the entire democratic world.</p>\n<iframe width=\'100%\' height=\'400px\' src=\'//www.youtube.com/embed/vCnSJ5yDv1g\' frameborder=\'0\' allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/15/watch-glenn-greenwald-explains-the-political-earthquake-in-brazil-caused-by-our-ongoing-exposes/">WATCH: Glenn Greenwald Explains the Political Earthquake in Brazil Caused by Our Ongoing Exposés</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Bit by bit,</u> President Donald Trump&#8217;s story of winning concessions on immigration enforcement from Mexico is falling apart. Last weekend, Trump announced that the U.S. and Mexico &#8220;reached a signed agreement&#8221; to stem the flow of mostly Central American migrants entering the U.S. through its southern border — the fruits, the administration suggested, of his threats to impose tariffs against the U.S.&#8217;s southern neighbor.</p>\n<p>That version of events was called into question by the New York Times, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html">reported</a> that Mexico was already carrying out or had been planning to carry out the actions that the administration claimed were part of a deal. Trump responded by insisting that there were “secret” provisions. On Wednesday, he waved a purported secret deal with Mexico in front of reporters. One photojournalist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/11/post-photographer-snapped-an-image-trumps-alleged-secret-mexico-deal-heres-what-it-says/?utm_term=.824af9081b16">captured</a> a partially legible backlit image, revealing that the paper described &#8220;a regional approach to burden-sharing in relation to the processing of refugee status claims to migrants.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;Mexico informally allowed for a third-country refugee resettlement process to begin; however, Mexico has not wanted to [be] open or public about it.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>Documents obtained by The Intercept suggest that this part of Trump’s deal also already existed before his tariff grandstanding. The documents affirm that an agreement has been in the works for months — with Mexico acquiescing to do more to process refugees on its soil since at least October 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mexico informally allowed for a third-country refugee resettlement process to begin; however, Mexico has not wanted to open or public about it [sic],” according to the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6153573-DHS-Breifing-Materials-for-November-2018-Meeting.html">documents</a>, a briefing backgrounder and talking points prepared for then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for a November 1 meeting with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.</p>\n<p>Third-country resettlement is the transfer of a refugee from one country of asylum to another that has agreed to take them. Worldwide, in 2018, the UNHCR resettled nearly 60,000 people, mostly Syrian and Congolese refugees. No such broad agreement yet exists to transfer people within the Americas.</p>\n<p>The documents, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, also lay out the U.S. government’s priorities around the migrant caravans of northbound Central Americans. Some of the details about U.S. immigration policy and DHS’s coordination with both Mexico and the UNHCR have never been published. DHS did not respond to requests for comment about the documents.</p>\n<p>For instance, Mexico was considering “granting all caravan members asylum as a group instead of individual reviewing their claims [sic],” according to the documents. DHS argued that such a policy might create a “pull factor” that attracts migrants and set an “unsustainable precedent,” although the documents conceded that Mexico “can set its own asylum policy just like the United States does.”</p>\n\n                <div id=\'dcv-6153573-DHS-Breifing-Materials-for-November-2018-Meeting\' class=\'document-cloud-container\' data-linking=\'documentcloud\' data-permalink=\'https://theintercept.com/document/2019/06/14/dhs-briefing-materials-for-november-2018-meeting-with-unhcr/\'></div>\n                <script>\n                    DV.load(\'//www.documentcloud.org/documents/6153573-DHS-Breifing-Materials-for-November-2018-Meeting.js\', {\n                        width: \'100%\',\n                        height: \'450\',\n                        sidebar: false,\n                        container: \'#dcv-6153573-DHS-Breifing-Materials-for-November-2018-Meeting\'\n                    });\n                </script>\n            \n<p><u>The documents obtained</u> by The Intercept lay out a piece of an ongoing process by the Trump administration to stop migrant caravans and other asylum-seekers from trying to enter the U.S. through Mexico. The caravans attracted Trump’s ire; the administration cracked down on the migrants at the border, firing tear gas at crowds that included children, and attempting, through various policy changes, to limit the options for people hoping to apply for asylum.</p>\n<p>The prep notes for Nielsen’s meeting add more color to the frenzied kitchen-sink approach the U.S. government is taking to stop migrants and asylum-seekers with often contradictory actions. They show the United States encouraging what would likely be an expensive third-country resettlement program at the same time that it was threatening to cut aid funding to Central America (the cuts were formally made this April) and attempting to create or revive programs similar to ones that the administration had canceled.</p>\n<p>Trump has presented his Mexico deal to stem the migrant flows as a major victory of his tough approach to not only immigrants themselves, but also the foreign nations he holds responsible for allowing the migrants through to the U.S. A more careful look at the crisis and these governments’ responses to it, however, reveal a complex web of national and international policies and dealmaking in which the Trump administration has won some concessions, but not in the triumphant manner it claims.</p>\n<p>The U.S. has repeatedly pushed Mexico to sign an official safe third-country agreement, which would force asylum-seekers who transit through Mexico to apply for protection there, but Mexico has refused to make such an agreement, according to an official with the Mexican foreign ministry. (The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press, and noted that they couldn’t comment on specific policy proposals that were considered before the new Mexican administration took office last December.) The official added that Mexico has repeatedly and publicly opposed the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-returns-exclusive/exclusive-asylum-seekers-returned-to-mexico-rarely-win-bids-to-wait-in-us-idUSKCN1TD13Z">so-called Migrant Protection Protocols</a>, under which would-be asylees in the U.S. have to remain in Mexico as their claims are processed.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="immigrants" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>Some limited-capacity refugee resettlement programs for Central Americans already exist, one of which is ongoing: the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/central-american-migrant-crisis_n_587016a7e4b02b5f8588e5d9">Protection Transfer Agreement</a>, an often overlooked initiative in El Salvador and Honduras that permits asylum-seekers to apply for protection within the country they intend to flee. In three years of work, the PTA has only resettled just over 300 people. In 2017, the Trump administration canceled another resettlement program, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/10/trump-administration-suddenly-cancels-refugee-program-that-saved-lives-of-central-american-children/">the Central American Minors program</a>, which permitted youth from the region to apply for protected status in the U.S. from their home countries.</p>\n<p>As the documents make clear, any resettlement program that would send refugees to the U.S. would be limited by the regional annual ceiling of 3,000 people. In other words, the U.S., even in discussing the expansion of third-country resettlement programs, is looking to foist responsibility for refugees, and their processing, onto Mexico and other countries. This week, Voice of America obtained a draft of an <a href="https://www.voanews.com/americas/us-guatemala-close-deal-block-central-american-asylum-seekers">alleged safe third-country agreement</a> between the U.S. and Guatemala. The draft agreement would require all Salvadorans and Hondurans seeking asylum to do so in Guatemala, before reaching Mexico’s southern border. U.S. officials are reportedly in talks with counterparts in Guatemala in an attempt to sign a deal quickly; Guatemala, meanwhile, faces contentious presidential elections on Sunday. With a nearly 60 percent poverty rate, an entrenched problem with corruption and violence, as well as an emigration trend of its own, the country hardly seems fit to process and welcome tens of thousands of fleeing Hondurans and Guatemalans. In 2017 and 2018 alone, nearly 50,000 Guatemalans applied for asylum in the U.S. Many more fled to Mexico or migrated to the U.S. without making an asylum claim.</p>\n<p>“It’s simply ludicrous for the United States to assert that Guatemala is capable of protecting refugees turned away from the United States at a time when its own citizens are fleeing violence and other failures of state protection,” Eleanor Acer of Human Rights First said in a statement in response to the reports.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254960" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-1149286126-1560533028.jpg" alt="US President Donald Trump holds piece of paper saying its his deal with Mexico as he speaks with reporters at the White House, in Washington, DC, on June 11, 2019. - Trump did not show the paper to reporters." /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a piece of paper, stating that it is a purported secret deal with Mexico, as he speaks with press at the White House on June 11, 2019.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p><u>The DHS talking</u> points offer a window into U.S. dealmaking in the region with Mexico and with UNHCR, which oversees international refugee resettlement for the world body. A UNHCR official, speaking to The Intercept on condition of anonymity as they were not permitted to speak to the press, confirmed that the meeting between Nielsen and Grandi took place, and that they discussed third-country refugee resettlement. UNHCR and Mexican officials both said that there have been no advances in discussion about third-country resettlement since — though the document itself referred to the Mexican efforts to keep any such agreements secret.</p>\n<p>In the briefing papers, DHS officials preparing the memos urged Nielsen to encourage UNHCR to begin gathering biometric data on migrants passing through Mexico and to “uncover any nefarious actors” and share that information with the United States. The UNHCR official, speaking on background, denied that the organization would gather such information from asylum-seekers, unless they were hoping to remain in Mexico and emphasized that they would not share that information with a third party, the U.S. The Mexican official concurred. The memo notes, however, that from October 18 to 23, DHS received from an unknown source the biometric data on 153 members of a migrant caravan with unspecified criminal convictions. As The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/08/us-mexico-border-journalists-harassment/">reported</a> earlier this year, the U.S., in cooperation with Mexican security agencies, surveilled, harassed, and detained organizers of the caravan, as well as journalists who were covering it.</p>\n<p>Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1138030976578310144">claims</a> that he intimidated Mexico into giving something “the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years.” But Mexico has been ramping up its immigration enforcement efforts since at least 2014, when the Obama administration pushed it to stop northward trans-Mexico migration in response to a sharp increase in unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.’s southern border. Last year, Mexico reluctantly agreed to a new series of measures, including the Migrant Protection Protocols. Mexico only agreed to the MPP “for humanitarian reasons,” the official told The Intercept. Expanding the program was part of the announced “agreement” made before the June 10 tariff deadline, along with Mexico’s deployment of troops to its border.</p>\n<p>Defending the effectiveness of the tariff threat, Trump insisted that part of the deal remained “secret.” “It was all done because of the tariffs,” he <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/12/trumps-secret-mexico-deal-over-migrants-captured-photographer/1429184001/">said</a>. Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, pushed back in a letter and a series of press conferences, insisting that there was no secret agreement.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The third-country refugee resettlement accord would be a major and long sought-after change to asylum processing in the region. A former DHS official, who asked for anonymity to speak about their past employment, confirmed that a regional resettlement program was under discussion in Mexico as of late 2018.</p>\n<p>According to the briefing papers obtained by The Intercept, Canada and Australia had been contacted by DHS and “were open to” serving as the final destination for successful Central American refugee and asylee applicants who filed from Mexico, if UNHCR also signed on. Costa Rica and Uruguay may eventually accept applicants too. (Requests for comment to the embassies of Canada, Australia, Costa Rica, and Uruguay were not immediately answered.)</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254959" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-1136603393-1560532929.jpg" alt="Central American migrants heading in caravan to the US rest at the park Hidalgo in Tapachula in Mexico on April 12, 2019. - A group of 350 Central American migrants forced their way into Mexico Friday, authorities said, as a new caravan of around 2,500 people arrived -- news sure to draw the attention of US President Donald Trump.

That program was canceled early this year, with Mexico’s top immigration official, Tonatiuh Guillén López, calling it “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/will-migrants-stay-in-mexico/">too successful</a>.” At the same time, Mexico’s budget for their refugee and asylum offices was <a href="https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/12/solicitudes-asilo-mexico-aumentan-recortan-presupuesto-refugiados/">slashed by 19 percent</a> between 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>“Our idea is not to build another wall,” the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs official told The Intercept. But violence and abuses against migrants in southern Mexico seems largely unchecked. Burgi-Palomino said that during a visit to southern Mexico, national guard troops recently deployed there were confused about their mission and seemed to be serving little purpose; she compared them to the bored National Guard troops deployed to the border in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In the end, the tariff threat seems to be an ineffectual political stunt, achieving little but startling global markets and bringing attention back on the Trump administration’s polestar: inciting panic about immigration. There are no signs that Mexico agreed to anything novel in this new round of discussions. And even if the U.S. eventually forces Mexico’s hand, or Guatemala&#8217;s, and more migrants and asylum-seekers find themselves unable to reach the U.S., the achievement will be little more than an outsourcing &#8212; rather than the elimination &#8212; of violence.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/trump-tariffs-mexico-refugees/">Mexico Made Refugee Concessions Months Before Trump Tariff Threats, DHS Documents Say</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

This is Constitutional Law 101, that it is Congress, not the president, that declares war,” Warren, a former law professor, said. “We would have to have a debate on the floor of the Senate. And if the administration doesn’t believe that they can withstand a debate, then they shouldn’t be aiming themselves toward war.”</p>\n<p>Asked if there was any way that the 2001 AUMF could be construed to extend to Iran, Warren said, “None, nope.”</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gabbard, for her part, said of Pompeo&#8217;s suggestion, “I completely disagree, 100% disagree. That’s one of the reasons why I have been so concerned about what this administration is doing. Because in their mind, they could unilaterally start a war with Iran, without congressional authorization, which would be unconstitutional and illegal.” </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said she wasn’t familiar with Pompeo’s comments. Kristin Lynch, spokesperson for Booker, said his co-sponsorship of a Senate </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1039"><span style="font-weight: 400">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that would prohibit the U.S. from spending money on military intervention in Iran without congressional authorization “speaks for itself.” Booker does not believe the 2001 AUMF can be used to authorize war with Iran, Lynch added.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A spokesperson for Gillibrand, Evan Lukaske, said that the senator “has consistently and forcefully pushed for the repeal of the AUMF, an eighteen-year old authorization that has been stretched far past its original intent.” Gillbrand “believes Congress must do its job and exercise oversight of the executive branch, particularly with the current administration, and believes President Trump, and all presidents for that matter, should seek Congressional approval before engaging in proactive military action,” Lukaske said in a statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sanders and Amy Klobuchar have signed onto the bill but did not respond to a request for comment on Pompeo’s remarks.

Gabbard said she’d want to read the bill, “but in theory, that’s exactly what we’re going for.” In its first 10 days, the Eshoo bill had only five </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2354/cosponsors"><span style="font-weight: 400">co-sponsors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">; it now has 59, including Ohio Democratic Rep.

That measure “specifically said nothing in this bill can be misconstrued to authorize the use of military force against Iran. I also wanted the same language against Venezuela. So covering both of these countries where this administration is hyping up tensions, threatening the use of military force, and so on. That’s something that we’ve got to remain vigilant on,” Gabbard said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously our role is to exercise oversight over the administration. As you well know, executive branch has overstepped their authority time and again when it comes to the use of military force. The major check and balance we have is the power of the purse strings, which is where the National Defense Authorization Act comes into play, because it prohibits the use of funding to carry out these things. And it sets policy,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gabbard said a “conclusion that found bipartisan support” during the markup was “putting forward a very explicit amendment that says the 2001 AUMF shall not be misconstrued as an authorization to use military force against Iran. Because as even [Rep.] Mac Thornberry said, it wouldn’t. This Iran thing has no correlation to Al Qaeda.” Gabbard said she’d also just reintroduced the No More Presidential Wars Resolution, which “seeks to get at the heart of this problem where Congress is not fulfilling its responsibility, the executive is overstepping its boundaries, and it makes it an impeachable offense for a president to unilaterally start a war without congressional authorization or declaration of war.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 15, 2019</strong><br />\n<em><span style="font-family: \'Georgia\',serif;color: #444444;letter-spacing: .1pt">This article has been updated with a statement from Sen.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>In April 2018,</u> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sat before members of both houses of Congress and told them his company respected the privacy of the roughly two billion people who use it. “Privacy” remained largely undefined throughout Zuckerberg’s televised flagellations, but he mentioned the concept more than two dozen times, including when he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/">told</a> the Senate&#8217;s Judiciary and Commerce committees, “We have a broader responsibility to protect people&#8217;s privacy even beyond” a consent decree from federal privacy regulators, and when he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">told</a> the House Energy and Commerce Committee, “We believe that everyone around the world deserves good privacy controls.” A year later, Zuckerberg claimed in <a href="http://fortune.com/longform/facebook-zuckerberg-sandberg-interviews/">interviews</a> and essays to have discovered the religion of personal privacy and vowed to rebuild the company in its image.</p>\n<p>But only months after Zuckerberg first outlined his “privacy-focused vision for social networking” in a 3,000-word <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">post</a> on the social network he founded, his lawyers were explaining to a California judge that privacy on Facebook is nonexistent.</p>\n<p>The courtroom debate, <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1164091/facebook-says-social-media-users-can-t-expect-privacy">first reported by Law360</a>, took place as Facebook tried to scuttle litigation from users upset that their personal data was shared without their knowledge with the consultancy Cambridge Analytica and later with advisers to Donald Trump’s campaign. <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6153329-05-29-2019-Facebook-Inc-Consumer-Privacy.html">The full transcript of the proceedings</a> — which has been quoted from only briefly — reveal one of the most stunning examples of corporate doublespeak certainly in Facebook’s history.</p>\n<p>Representing Facebook before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was Orin Snyder of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, who claimed that the plaintiffs’ charges of privacy invasion were invalid because Facebook users have no expectation of privacy on Facebook. The simple act of using Facebook, Snyder claimed, negated any user’s expectation of privacy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is no privacy interest, because by sharing with a hundred friends on a social media platform, which is an affirmative social act to publish, to disclose, to share ostensibly private information with a hundred people, you have just, under centuries of common law, under the judgment of Congress, under the SCA, negated any reasonable expectation of privacy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An outside party can’t violate what you yourself destroyed, Snyder seemed to suggest. Snyder was emphatic in his description of Facebook as a sort of privacy anti-matter, going so far as to claim that “the social act of broadcasting your private information to 100 people negates, as a matter of law, any reasonable expectation of privacy.” You’d be hard-pressed to come up with a more elegant, concise description of Facebook than “the social act of broadcasting your private information” to people. So not only is it Facebook’s legal position that you’re not entitled to any expectation of privacy, but it’s your fault that the expectation went poof the moment you started using the site (or at least once you connected with 100 Facebook “friends”).</p>\n<p>Judge Chhabria was skeptical of Snyder’s privacy nonexistence argument at times, which he rejected as treating personal privacy as a binary, “like either you have a full expectation of privacy, or you have no expectation of privacy at all,” the judge put it at one point. Chhabria continued with a relatable hypothetical:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If I share [information] with ten people, that doesn&#8217;t eliminate my expectation of privacy. It might diminish it, but it doesn&#8217;t eliminate it. And if I share something with ten people on the understanding that the entity that is helping me share it will not further disseminate it to a thousand companies, I don&#8217;t understand why I don&#8217;t have — why that&#8217;s not a violation of my expectation of privacy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Snyder responded with an incredible metaphor for how Facebook sees your use of its services — legally, at least:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me give you a hypothetical of my own. I go into a classroom and invite a hundred friends. This courtroom. I invite a hundred friends, I rent out the courtroom, and I have a party. And I disclose — And I disclose something private about myself to a hundred people, friends and colleagues. Those friends then rent out a 100,000-person arena, and they rebroadcast those to 100,000 people. I have no cause of action because by going to a hundred people and saying my private truths, I have negated any reasonable expectation of privacy, because the case law is clear.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And there it is, in broad daylight: Using Facebook is a depressing party taking place in a courtroom, for some reason, that’s being simultaneously broadcasted to a 100,000-person arena on a sort of time delay. If you show up at the party, don’t be mad when your photo winds up on the Jumbotron. That is literally the company’s legal position.</p>\n<p>Again and again, Snyder blames the targets of surveillance capitalism for their own surveillance:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is why every parent says to their child, &#8220;Do not post it on Facebook if you don&#8217;t want to read about it tomorrow morning in the school newspaper,&#8221; or, as I tell my young associates if I were going to be giving them an orientation, &#8220;Do not put anything on social media that you don&#8217;t want to read in the Law Journal in the morning.&#8221; There is no expectation of privacy when you go on a social media platform, the purpose of which, when you are set to friends, is to share and communicate things with a large group of people, a hundred people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At one point Chhabria asked, seemingly unable to believe Snyder’s argument himself, “If Facebook promises not to disseminate anything that you send to your hundred friends, and Facebook breaks that promise and disseminates your photographs to a thousand corporations, that would not be a serious privacy invasion?</p>\n<p>Snyder didn’t blink: “Facebook does not consider that to be actionable, as a matter of law under California law.”</p>\n<p>Facebook’s counsel did seem to concede one possibility for the existence of privacy on Facebook: someone who uses Facebook completely contrary to the way it’s designed and to the way it has always been marketed. “If you really want to be private,” Snyder proposed to the court, “there are people who have archival Facebook pages that are like their own private mausoleum. It&#8217;s only set to [be visible by] me, and it&#8217;s for the purpose of repository, you know, of your private information, and no one will ever see that.” So these are your possible valid legal statuses as a Facebook user: You’re either plugged into the 100,0000-person perpetual surveillance Coachella or living in a digital “mausoleum.” But if you ever decide to fling open the doors of your private data crypt and, say, share a little content on Facebook with friends, as the company has been pushing us for the past 13 years, Snyder says you’re out of luck:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once you go to friends, the gig is over because you&#8217;ve just gone — taken a hundred people and pronounced your personal likes and dislikes. In fact, the very act of liking something and showing your friends that you like something is a non-private act. It&#8217;s the whole premise of Facebook and social media, is to render not private your likes, your dislikes, your expressions. When I tag someone in a photo, it&#8217;s to tell people, not keep private, that I&#8217;m sitting on a park bench with John Smith. So it&#8217;s the opposite of private when you do that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook’s stance that if one truly wants to keep something private, they should keep it far from Facebook is odd — odder, still, given the fact that the company publishes an extremely detailed privacy policy, perhaps only meant for those huddling in private mausoleums where such a principle still exists.</p>\n<p>“Facebook was built to bring people closer together,” reads the start of the company’s “Privacy Principles.&#8221; “We help you connect with friends and family, discover local events and find groups to join.” Not mentioned is that if you do any of that, it’s Facebook’s official opinion that you’ve “negated” your claim to any privacy whatsoever. The list of principles reads like a bad joke after studying Snyder’s courtroom theorizing: “We design privacy into our products from the outset” seems hard to reconcile with “Once you go to friends, the gig is over.” It’s similarly hard to take “We give you control of your privacy” seriously after hearing, through Snyder, that because Facebook users “shared the information &#8230; you&#8217;ve lost control over the information and its subsequent disclosure.”</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>So which is true, then? Are we to believe Orin Snyder when he says Facebook privacy is an oxymoron and that showing something to even a small group of friends completely forfeits your right to privacy, or Mark Zuckerberg when, this past March, he wrote, “We’ve worked hard to build privacy into all our products, including those for public sharing.” These statements can’t both be true, and yet they appear to originate from the same company, albeit from two separate sides of its mouth. Perhaps Snyder is right when he tells the judge that the litigation isn’t <i>really </i>about just Facebook, but rather, the “Complaint is really a Complaint about ubiquitous sharing on social media platforms. &#8230; They don&#8217;t like it because when you go on a social media platform and share your information with a hundred people, you&#8217;ve lost control. And that creates anxiety, and that creates concern.” It will be interesting to watch Facebook confront this public dread in multiple ways at once, as if originating in completely different dimensions, apologizing for their misdeeds in media tours while denying any wrongdoing in the relative privacy of court.</p>\n<p>Neither Facebook nor Orin Snyder responded to a request for comment. Plaintiff’s counsel declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/facebook-privacy-policy-court/">In Court, Facebook Blames Users for Destroying Their Own Right to Privacy</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

Polanco was being held on $500 bail owing to misdemeanor charges for a prostitution-related offense, in addition to the lowest-level drug charge. The New York medical examiner has not yet determined the cause of her death.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>Polanco’s death sits at the intersection of some of the criminal justice system’s worst excesses.</blockquote>\n<p>These sparse details alone are enough to know that Polanco’s death sits at the intersection of some of the criminal justice system’s worst excesses: the criminalization of sex workers and the policing of trans women of color that it entails; the cash bail system; the use of solitary confinement; and the fact that institutions like Rikers exist at all.</p>\n<p>“Layleen’s interactions with the criminal legal system exemplify the ways in which our state sanctions violence against trans and gender non-confirming communities of color,” said a <a href="https://twitter.com/DecrimNY/status/1138510992969818114/photo/2">statement</a> from Decrim NY, a coalition working toward the full decriminalization of consensual sex work in New York state. “Polanco’s death was caused by an all-too-common overlap of three aspects of the criminal legal system: She was criminalized for sex work. She was held on $500 bail for misdemeanor charges. And she was placed in solitary confinement.”</p>\n<p>On Monday <a href="https://www.out.com/news/2019/6/11/trans-new-yorkers-call-action-layleen-cubilette-polanco-rally">night</a>, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Manhattan to pay tribute to Polanco and to join in her family and the broader LGBTQ+ community’s calls for answers and justice. Polanco, also known as Layleen Xtravaganza, was a member of the iconic New York ballroom family, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/the-house-of-xtravaganza-at-35.html">House of Xtravaganza</a>. Her death, coinciding with celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://2019-worldpride-stonewall50.nycpride.org/events/stonewall-50th-commemoration/">Stonewall Uprising</a>, stands as a stark reminder that the struggle goes on to end state violence against trans and queer lives.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we don’t have her here right now pisses me the fuck off, and the fact that they left her and neglected her is not right,” <a href="https://www.out.com/news/2019/6/11/trans-new-yorkers-call-action-layleen-cubilette-polanco-rally">said</a> actress and model Gisele Alicea, the mother of the House of Xtravaganza, on Monday night. According to statements from David Shanies, Polanco’s attorney, the staff at Rikers knew that Polanco had a serious seizure disorder.</p>\n<p><u>The New York</u> City Department of Correction said it is conducting a “full investigation” into what happened to Polanco in its facility. The fact remains, however, that the young woman should never have been incarcerated in the first place.</p>\n<p>In <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2019/04/new-york-ends-cash-bail-for-most-what-it-means-for-people-charged-with-a-crime.html">April</a>, the New York State Legislature passed a bill to end cash bail for most misdemeanor and low-level offenses, but the law doesn’t go into effect until January 2020. Polanco’s death highlighted the urgency of abolishing the cash bail system nationwide and ensuring that such laws are properly enacted.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>The timing of Polanco’s death is rife with grim ironies.</blockquote>\n<p>That a judge, knowing full well that legislation had been passed to end cash bail for these offenses, would nonetheless incarcerate a person like Polanco for failing to pay bail speaks to the cruelty of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p>The timing of Polanco’s death is rife with other grim ironies. On Monday — three days after Polanco’s death and the same day that New Yorkers rallied in her memory — progressive state lawmakers <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/154111/new-york-bill-decriminalization-prostitution-sex-worker-rights">introduced</a> the nation’s most robust bill for the decriminalization of sex work. If passed, the bill &#8212; the work of years of sex worker rights organizing and advocacy to build previously unthinkable political will for reform &#8212; would make New York the first state to fully decriminalize consensual sex work. It would put an end to cases like Polanco’s, who was arrested by an undercover cop in a prostitution sting in 2017.</p>\n<p>Transgender women — particularly transgender women of color — disproportionately turn to sex work, in the face of grave discrimination in other industries. <a href="http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/Meaningful%20Work-Full%20Report_FINAL_3.pdf">Analysis</a> by the National Transgender Discrimination Survey in 2015 found that of 6,400 transgender individuals asked, 40 percent of black or black multiracial respondents and 33 percent of Latinx-identified respondents had participated in the sex trade.</p>\n<p>Police nationwide have made <a href="https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1461&amp;context=wmjowl">a habit</a> of targeting trans women of color for prostitution arrests, stings, and bogus charges like “loitering for prostitution.” While some locales have instituted partial decriminalization and programs like diversion courts to avoid the appearance of draconian policies, cases like Polanco’s give the lie to claims that these approaches do not punish sex workers. Polanco, for instance, was first sent to human trafficking court after her arrest, but a warrant was issued for her to be taken into custody again after she missed court dates.</p>\n<p>“[A]ll of these supposed reforms didn’t do anything for Layleen,” <a href="https://twitter.com/DecrimNY/status/1138510992969818114/photo/2">said</a> Jessica Peñaranda, director of movement building at the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center and a Decrim NY steering committee member, in a statement. “The clients we serve view diversion court and criminal court as one in the same: The trauma and violence of interacting with court officers, police officers, judges and district attorneys who have authority to send you to jail, all of that is no different.”</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>Only full decriminalization, like in the new proposed bill, removes criminal legal coercion from sex workers’ lives — something that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/26/decriminalize-sex-work-new-york/">can’t be said often enough</a>. Without economic justice and an end to transphobic persecution, there will still be no justice for women like Polanco. But full sex work decriminalization would allow the space for those struggles to continue without the added threat of police and carceral violence.</p>\n<p><u>At the end</u> of April, in recognition of the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/271-19/she-built-nyc-mayor-de-blasio-first-lady-mccray-monument-honoring-pioneering-trans#/0">announced</a> that the city would erect a monument in honor of the transgender activists and Stonewall uprising leaders Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. The official recognition of these liberation fighters is welcome and long overdue. “Transgender and nonbinary communities are reeling from violent and discriminatory attacks across the country,” de Blasio said during his announcement. “Here in New York City, we are sending a clear message: We see you for who you are, we celebrate you, and we will protect you.”</p>\n<p>Yet it was New York City institutions that killed Layleen Polanco Xtravaganza — and will continue to destroy the lives of transgender women of color while sex work is criminalized, trans communities are stigmatized, and jails and prisons remain full of the poor and persecuted.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/13/layleen-polanco-death-rikers-trans-woman-sex-work/">How New York&#8217;s Criminal Justice System Killed a Transgender Woman at Rikers Island</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Lead organizers from</u> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 campaign are taking on the consultant class with a new initiative to train the next generation of progressive organizers and staffers. Movement School, a 10-week professional development program launched by Organize for Justice, the sister organization of Justice Democrats, is teaching fellows how to work as campaign managers, communications directors, and field directors.</p>\n<p>The Campaign Fellows program is meant to create a pathway for young activists from working-class backgrounds to enter official campaign roles and to preserve the lessons grassroots campaigns have learned throughout the years by passing them down to future staffers — all while setting up an alternative political infrastructure that operates outside of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the progressive movement’s work to build its own political infrastructure may have been inadvertently accelerated by a policy designed to suppress the party’s insurgent wing. In March, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/27/progressive-caucus-slams-dccc-head-cheri-bustos-for-her-assault-on-primary-challengers/">a new policy</a> to blacklist any firms working for primary challengers, effectively protecting the party’s white, male incumbents in safe blue seats.</p>\n<p>As a result of the DCCC blacklist, several consultants<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/26/dccc-blacklist-marie-newman-dan-lipinski/"> dropped the primary campaign</a> of Marie Newman, the pro-abortion rights progressive who has launched a second challenge to Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the few anti-abortion Democrats in the House. Despite the blacklist, organizations like EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, have still rallied behind Newman’s challenge. A Movement School participant even went on to work for Newman after the trainings.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;Too often local and state governments are dominated by big money politics, and the policy preferences of the majority, of working people, aren’t reflected.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to creating a pipeline for diverse talent, the program is meant to help first-time candidates connect with progressive staffers, Movement School co-founder Gabe Tobias said, circumventing consultants and pollsters who advise against talking about ambitious left-wing policies out of fear it turns off voters “without any evidence to back that up.”</p>\n<p>The DCCC often discourages first-time candidates from running as progressives, Tobias said, so a critical aspect of the school is that “you’re learning about campaigns but not in a value-neutral space, like, &#8216;whatever wins votes is a good thing.&#8217;”</p>\n<p>Aspiring candidates “get told, ‘If you wanna run in this race, then you can’t, you know, talk about Medicare for All, you can’t talk about Green New Deal; you have to keep it down, keep the volume down,’” he added. Their program, meanwhile, is meant to show that candidates who stick with their values can actually win elections. The message they’re sending is this: “We’ll surround you with the best staff possible, people who will help make that happen,” he said. “That’s an exciting piece of it, too, for the folks who are a little bit on unsteady legs in the early stage of their political careers.”</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>The program’s first cohort, which graduated in May, was made up of 40 fellows from 24 different states. According to Movement School, 82 percent of its first graduating class were people of color, 80 percent from working-class backgrounds, and 71 percent are women or nonbinary.</p>\n<p>Because existing political infrastructure is stacked with establishment-friendly people, progressives don’t see their priorities reflected in policy, said Emmanuel Caicedo, associate director of campaigns at Demos, a left-wing think tank. &#8220;Things like Movement School, where we wanna get more progressive leaders trained at the local level, the state level, matter a lot because the current infrastructure isn’t serving our policies,” said Caicedo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Too often local and state governments are dominated by big money politics, and the policy preferences of the majority, of working people, aren’t reflected,” Caicedo added, “so what you get is a political system where leaders are doing the work of the 1 percent.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Volunteers from Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign informally ran a version of the program in 2018, teaching best campaign practices to boost 13 campaigns in New York and across the country. The national program is operated almost entirely online, with sessions devoted to unionizing campaigns, digital security, and understanding the electorate.</span></p>\n<p>In addition to Ocasio-Cortez campaign alum, staffers from Bernie Sanders’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, Stacey Abrams’s 2018 gubernatorial campaign, Tom Perriello’s 2017 gubernatorial campaign, and staffers from Justice Democrats are among the mentors leading trainings in the professional development program.</p>\n<p>One of the school’s participants, 27-year-old Marshele Bryant, said part of what’s so special about Movement School is that the initiative is “really trying to make way for young folks, some extremely progressive folks, who want to move the Democratic Party further.”</p>\n<p>“It’s just really exciting to see so much energy being put in to kind of shaping and molding folks and giving them the tools that they need in order to enter into different campaigns at all different levels,” she added.</p>\n<p>Bryant, a statewide campus organizer for the Virginia Student Power Network, said she found the finance sessions particularly useful.</p>\n<p>“A lot of us in the program weren’t really well-versed in the finance aspect of campaigns,” she said. “So we had a lot of sessions about what it takes to create a budget, what you should be spending money on, what you should account for, you know, different scenarios about if you get an influx of donations versus if your donations kind of dry up at a certain point.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/13/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-campaign-training-school/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#8217;s Campaign Organizers Are Training Working-Class Progressives to Take on the Consultant Class</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

Yet that appetite for radicalism has been sorely lacking on the foreign policy front, with the candidates mostly mouthing the same noncommittal platitudes we’ve come to expect from cautious presidential contenders. Why is it that the policy area in which American presidents have the most power and the most freedom to shape world events is so often overlooked in our political campaigns? Atlantic contributor and City University of New York professor Peter Beinart joins Mehdi Hasan to talk about why Democrats are so timid on foreign policy.</p>\n<p><b>Peter Beinart: </b>There is a notion of what is responsible in foreign policy that is often not seriously and thoughtfully questioned, a notion that the expansion of the American military footprint is always synonymous with enhancing the well-being of ordinary Americans.</p>\n<p>[Music interlude.]</p>\n<p><b>Mehdi Hasan: </b>Welcome to Deconstructed. I’m Mehdi Hasan. When oh, when are we gonna talk foreign policy? It feels like no matter how many foreign wars the U.S. is fighting, no matter how many people are dying, no matter how much it matters, what happens abroad, overseas, far away, in the ‘obscure’ and ‘complex’ realm of foreign policy, that feels like a bit of an afterthought for most of the Democratic presidential candidates.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>They&#8217;re not really trying to break down the ideological boundaries that have defined foreign policy in the way they are with domestic policy.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That’s my guest today, the journalist, academic, and author Peter Beinart. On today’s show, he and I will be asking and trying to answer the question: why won’t the Democrats take a stronger, more radical stand on changing America’s awful, awful foreign policy?</p>\n<p>Here’s what really frustrates me: we’re only a few months into the Democratic presidential race and we’ve already seen candidates from across the political spectrum make big, bold moves on a variety of domestic policy issues. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren, who’s enjoying a bit of a bump in the polls right now.</p>\n<p><b>Elizabeth Warren: </b>There are people who are ready for big structural change in this country. They&#8217;re ready for change and I got a plan for that.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Her plans range from a new wealth tax on assets over $50 million and a new tax on corporate profits to student debt cancellation, free college, universal child care. Then there’s Senator Bernie Sanders, the only socialist in the race who has made healthcare his number one issue.</p>\n<p><b>Harry Smith: </b>What&#8217;s your big idea?</p>\n<p><b>Bernie Sanders: </b>Medicare for all.</p>\n<p><b>HS: </b>Does that mean all?</p>\n<p><b>BS: </b>Yeah, it means all.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Senator Kamala Harris wants, among other things, a national moratorium on the death penalty and the decriminalization of sex work. Senator Cory Booker wants to use baby bonds to close the racial wealth gap. Congressman Eric Swalwell wants to ban assault weapons and do a government buy-back.</p>\n<p>Several of the presidential candidates have signed onto the ambitious Green New Deal to fight climate change. In fact, Washington governor Jay Inslee has been praised for introducing a massively detailed plan to rapidly decarbonize the U.S. economy. So too has former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke, who unveiled a $5 trillion plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>\n<p><b>Beto O&#8217;Rourke: </b>We’re talking about five trillion invested in infrastructure, in innovation. This is by far the most ambitious plan to confront climate change that we have ever seen.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>But while the Democrats have got much more radical, much more progressive, much more ambitious on domestic policy — whether it’s tax policy, energy policy, housing, healthcare, education, etc — we’ve heard very, very little when it comes to foreign policy. I mean, look, yes, Bernie Sanders has said some stuff. Last week, he used MoveOn’s Big Ideas forum to pitch a pretty strong antiwar message.</p>\n<p><b>BS: </b>We have got to stop endless wars. We have got to cut military spending.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>And Mayor Pete Buttigieg said this week that he wants Congress to take back its constitutionally designated role when it comes to deciding matters of war and peace:</p>\n<p><b>Pete Buttigieg: </b>The time has come for Congress to repeal and replace that blank check on the use of force and ensure a robust debate on any future operations.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>And yet, as a general rule, I think it’s fair to say that foreign policy has taken a backseat in this Democratic presidential race so far. Which is so weird on so many levels. Because presidents actually have way more power and freedom when it comes to foreign policy than they do on domestic policy. Most presidencies are defined as much by foreign policy as they are by domestic policy &#8211; if not more so. Think of Nixon and the war crimes in Southeast Asia; Reagan and the Berlin Wall, George Bush Sr. and the Gulf War; George Bush Jr. and the War on Terror; Obama even and his Libya war, his drone war, his Iran Deal.</p>\n<p>And yet while there’s been this shift to the left on domestic policy from almost all of the major presidential candidates, there hasn’t been an equivalent left-wing shift on foreign policy. In fact, on the issue of Russia, Democrats including Bernie Sanders have attacked Trump from the right. And speaking of Trump, this president has been a disaster on the international stage. So why aren’t Democrats making more of that?</p>\n<p>Last year, the New York Times got hold of a White House document sent to Congress which made it very clear that the United States government right now is fighting wars in seven countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Niger. Candidate Trump remember, claimed to be the Republican isolationist candidate, the anti-war candidate.</p>\n<p><b>Donald J. Trump: </b>For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed, totally failed, foreign policy.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>And yet, President Trump has escalated or expanded U.S. involvement in every single one of those seven conflicts. So much for ‘Donald the Dove!&#8217;</p>\n<p>Then there’s Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb and besiege the poorest country in the Middle East with U.S. diplomatic and military support. Why aren’t Democrats putting out ads saying this president is pro-genocide? He’s pro-killing kids? Because he blatantly is. When he signed that veto in April, when he blocked a bill that was pushed by some Republicans but mainly by Democrats to end the Yemen war, that conflict became, lock, stock and barrel, Trump’s war, not just Obama’s war.</p>\n<p>But maybe that’s part of the equation. Maybe Democrats don’t want to draw attention to how much Obama got wrong when it comes to foreign policy: his support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen when it kicked off in 2015; the complete botched U.S. covert intervention in Syria and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in that country on Obama’s watch; the war in Libya which has left that country looking like a Mad Max hellscape; the drone wars in Pakistan and Yemen with their civilian death tolls; the failure to make progress on the Israel-Palestine conflict; the failed pivot to Asia; the failed reset with Russia.</p>\n<p>Maybe Democrats also can’t agree on what a progressive new foreign policy should look like. Because let’s face it: a lot of conservative Democrats, and even some liberal ones, are quite hawkish and like big wars. Maybe they’re also just as influenced as the Republicans are by the pro-Israel and pro-Saudi lobbies, by the military-industrial complex, by the foreign policy think tank Blob in Washington DC. Or, maybe, they just assume, rightly or wrongly, that ordinary Americans don’t give a damn about foreign affairs, about faraway conflicts in faraway lands.</p>\n<p>[Music interlude.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>So I wanted to talk about some of this stuff with Peter Beinart, contributing editor at The Atlantic, senior columnist at the Forward, and a professor of journalism and political science at the City University of New York.</p>\n<p>He’s written a bunch of pieces recently on the Democrats’ failure to come up with a China policy that varies from Trump’s, the party’s hawkishness on Iran, and the weakness of the rhetoric coming from most Democratic presidential candidates when it comes to Israel and the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p>\n<p>Peter, by the way, as editor of the New Republic magazine back in 2003 enthusiastically supported the invasion of Iraq. But I think it’s fair to say he holds very different view today, and is now a leading U.S. media critic of the “forever wars.” He joins me now.</p>\n<p>Peter, thanks for joining me on Deconstructed.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>My pleasure.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Peter, am I being unfair when I say the Democrats haven&#8217;t just failed to match the boldness and radicalism on domestic policy that they&#8217;re showing these days, with boldness and radicalism on foreign policy? They haven&#8217;t just failed to match that on foreign policy, but the foreign policy isn&#8217;t even getting a look in when you look at the campaigns of the most of the Democratic presidential candidates.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>No, I think that&#8217;s fair. They&#8217;re not talking about it very much, partly because it&#8217;s not what&#8217;s mostly on voters minds, which is the norm in the United States when the United States is not in a war where a lot of Americans are dying. That&#8217;s just the reality of our political system. But I also don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing very much to kind of generate the kind of conversation in the Democratic party that will be necessary for them to build a mandate to really change things if they get in office.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Good point, people always forget about the idea that you have to, you know, lay the groundwork, if you want to make changes in office and the way they have done in Medicare for all, for example. It&#8217;s been going on for a few years now moving that debate on health care. The Democrats on foreign policy seem to want to go back to business as usual on foreign policy back to a pre-Trump era, even though I would argue that business as usual, and the pre-Trump era was pretty shitty in terms of American policy on human rights, democracy, greenhouse gas emissions and the rest.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Yeah, I think Sanders is a little bit, Bernie Sanders is a little bit of an exception to that. Hillary Clinton, I think it&#8217;s worth remembering in 2016, was running a little bit to Obama&#8217;s right on foreign policy. She was a little bit more hawkish. To be fair, the Democrats aren&#8217;t doing that they might be even a quarter of a step more dove-ish than Obama, but what they&#8217;re not doing, which is the big distinction that you&#8217;re rightly making, is they&#8217;re not really trying to break down the ideological boundaries that have defined foreign policy in the way they are with domestic policy. And I think —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Why do you think that is?</p>\n<p><b>PB:</b> I think it&#8217;s, again, I think, partly because they don&#8217;t feel that they&#8217;re being, the public is not demanding it. But I also think that the foreign policy establishment, the people who make foreign policy, many of whom are you know, good, well-meaning people, but I think they are more insulated from public pressure. And they are not, they&#8217;ve not had to kind of grapple with the deep sense of failure and radicalism that has emerged among ordinary grassroots Democrats, they remained fairly insulated from that. That&#8217;s because foreign policy in the United States is a much more elite-driven business than domestic policy.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yes, with very little accountability, the people who got Iraq wrong or other wars wrong, they&#8217;re still around advocating for new wars. You mentioned the whole concept of whether you&#8217;re a tad to the left or right of Obama, or Clinton. You wrote a piece late last year for The Atlantic, where you made the point, in fact, a very valid point that a lot of the Democrats, senior democrats in DC have been attacking Trump from the right on foreign policy, when you look at things like China or Russia or North Korea, do you think that&#8217;s a strategic move on their part where they genuinely believe this stuff, but you know, they genuinely want to have a hawkish position on North Korea forever?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>I think it&#8217;s a bit of both. I think there is certainly a long hangover, which started from the post-Vietnam era and was re-invigorated a little bit in the post 9/11 era of Democrats always looking over their right shoulder and fearing not to be seen as tough enough, especially when it comes to anything — And that&#8217;s partly because the Republican Party had kind of become the party that was more entrenched in the military over the decades. But I also think that there is a notion of what is responsible in foreign policy that is often not really, very seriously and thoughtfully questioned.</p>\n<p>So, you know, a notion that, kind of, that the expansion of the American military footprint is all things being equal, kind of, always synonymous with enhancing the well-being of ordinary Americans. And I think one of the reasons that Trump won the Republican primary in particular, and that also helped him the general election is that he was actually willing to challenge that equation. And I think that Democrats, although Trump&#8217;s own foreign policy has been totally disastrous. I think actually, that would be a good place for Democrats to start in rethinking some of the basic assumptions that tend to lead to this kind of expansionist foreign policy that we have.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>It was amazing in 2015, 2016, the way in which he up ended the Republican party consensus on foreign policy compared to Mitt Romney&#8217;s platform in 2012. I remember seeing, you know, when he made the comment about John McCain, you know, I like people who aren&#8217;t captured. We thought his campaign was over in 2015. You can&#8217;t attack a war hero on the right. And he got away with it. When he stood in the debates, I remember watching the debate on TV where he said, Well, George W. Bush, what did he say 9/11 happened on his watch? He kind of mocked Jeb.</p>\n<p>And the crowd, some people in the crowd booed but others cheered. And the next day, it didn&#8217;t affect his poll rating at all. And of course, he went on about how he had been anti-war in Iraq, which he wasn&#8217;t he lied, but he said he was. He said he was anti-war in Libya. Again, he lied, but he said he was and it all helped him. It didn&#8217;t hurt him. And I wonder where in 2020 in this race on the Democratic side, we talked about — Let&#8217;s talk about Bernie. Is Bernie Sanders the person who&#8217;s willing to do that in this race, up-end things?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>More than any other candidate. Again, I think it&#8217;s partly because just he&#8217;s more distant from the Democratic foreign policy establishment. And I think he&#8217;s begun to do some of that. So, he has, for instance, asked the question, really, you know, is Saudi Arabia really morally superior to Iran, for instance, why necessarily? You know, the mainstream Democratic view is kind of, yes, the Iran deal was good but we need to take a very hawkish position on Iran, because they are a uniquely aggressive and immoral actor in the Middle East. So, you see a kind of a half step in a positive direction towards Trump, but not a really fundamental kind of questioning of some of the deeper assumptions, right?</p>\n<p>I mean, I think the Islamic Republic of Iran is a pretty, is a really odious regime, in terms of what they do domestically and I think they do a lot of bad stuff in the region. But when one looks at their prime regional competitors, particularly, you know, Saudi Arabia, in the UAE, I find it very difficult to see that there&#8217;s an important moral distinction. And I think it would be better for the United States to actually try to have a business-like working relationship with both of those regimes in order to give ourselves the most leverage, and for us to try to cool down, try to kind of diffuse the Cold War in the region, rather than heating it up. And it&#8217;s striking to me that that&#8217;s still not, except for Bernie a little bit, that&#8217;s not really something you hear from the Democratic candidates.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>No, and we&#8217;ll come on to Elizabeth Warren in a moment. But she&#8217;s been very hawkish on Iran in the past, I remember. What&#8217;s interesting about Bernie, I interviewed him in 2017 on foreign policy before he gave this big speech on foreign policy. And of course, I&#8217;m sure many of our listeners remember that Bernie was actually attacked in 2016, for not having any foreign policy, for not being willing to talk about foreign policy. He was up against a former secretary of state who was touting her national security foreign policy credentials.</p>\n<p>I remember Bernie was asked who advises you and he came up with a few names and all those people then denied that they were advisers to Bernie Sanders. What&#8217;s interesting is since then, he&#8217;s hired people like Matt Duss, kind of progressive foreign policy thinker and we&#8217;ve seen the shift again. He&#8217;s laid the groundwork on Yemen, on Israel, on dealing with Iran and Saudi Arabia. I remember when I interviewed him 2017, he said at the time, why are we not equidistant between Iran and Saudi? In fact, I think the Iranian people are probably more pro-American than the Saudis are. And it was kind of radical to hear him say that at the time, again, the bench that you know, the bar is so low, the benchmark is so low.</p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s interesting is this idea of staffing. If Elizabeth Warren —who&#8217;s also said some very interesting things on foreign policy, talking about ending the war in Afghanistan, you know, the use of nuclear weapons and resisting that — if someone like her became president, see what you think about this scenario, Peter. I like Elizabeth Warren. I think she&#8217;s got great policies on the domestic front. She&#8217;s got a whole &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a plan for that&#8221; stuff. If she becomes president, is there a danger that she&#8217;s really progressive radical on the domestic front, and that&#8217;s what she knows. That&#8217;s her baby. That&#8217;s what she knows about. That&#8217;s what she instinctively cares about. And then she then ends up outsourcing foreign policy to the democratic foreign policy establishment, to the Clinton retreads, which is what Obama did on economic policy if you remember, in 2008, when he came in, he kind of hired Larry Summers and Tim Geithner and that was reflected in the policy, the staffing matters.</p>\n<p><b>PB:</b> It matters enormously. I think you&#8217;re making a very, very good point and you have to work very aggressively to overcome the powerful inertia that exists. You know, there&#8217;s a history. If you look at John F. Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama, they were all on foreign policy to the left of their most powerful adviser. You know, they were all more willing to reconsider, in the case of Kennedy and Carter, the Cold War. And then in the case of Obama, the war on terror, and they were in many ways circumscribed and hemmed in by the people they had brought in to be their top advisers who were people who came from an establishment that they felt like they needed to curry favor with.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Well, Obama had Robert Gates, former Republican. He had Leon Panetta, former Bill Clinton Chief of Staff, yeah.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Right, and Hillary Clinton was more established than him and James Jones remember his first national security adviser had been friends of John McCain. And this, to shift this is not easy. It requires you actually to have people who are willing to push, in a weird way, it almost requires you to have your own versions of the John Boltons of the world. People who are willing to push aggressively through a bureaucracy to try to make change, otherwise, you end up being hemmed in. I mean, if you look at Obama&#8217;s Afghanistan decision, it was pretty clear that he realized that he didn&#8217;t think that sending more troops to Afghanistan in his first year was going to do a lot of good, but he really was very hemmed in by the military in particular, which is, you know, has enormous weight in these interagency debates. And I think right now, my worry that Elizabeth Warren, who I also admire a lot, in a lot of ways, is not positioning herself necessarily to do that.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>No, it&#8217;s a very good point. And of course, Trump himself who played this fake anti-war card when he was running, he had the same decision to make on Afghanistan as Obama in terms of troop numbers, troop levels, and we know that his then National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, put a lot of pressure on him not to pull troops out in the way that Trump wanted to, and we&#8217;re still in Afghanistan now. I think, what is it, I saw somewhere that they&#8217;re now sending troops to Afghanistan, who were not born on 9/11. We&#8217;ve now reached that point in America&#8217;s longest war, which is an astonishing statistic.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Right, I mean, we even see this in this bizarre way with Trump, whereas in some ways, the person who&#8217;s putting the brakes on the possibility of war with North Korea and Iran is Trump, you know, because he has kind of Republican establishment foreign policy advisers who basically pursue an ultra-confrontational policy with these countries.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yeah, it&#8217;s a weird, bizarre combo there. It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned Bolton. I was having a conversation with a colleague just before we started recording this interview and I was talking about, you know, what I&#8217;m going to be talking to you about. We were talking about the same issue of staffing and like, who would Bernie Sanders make his national security advisor? And I was kind of joking about the fact that — maybe it&#8217;s not a joke — that Trump has changed all the rules. He&#8217;s brought in such weird, unqualified, freakish people.</p>\n<p>You know, when you have Sebastian Gorka, as a special assistant to the president working in the White House with zero real, zero qualifications, why couldn&#8217;t Bernie Sanders — in the aftermath of a Trump presidency and a John Bolton as a national security adviser — why couldn&#8217;t Bernie Sanders pluck some lefty academic who no one&#8217;s ever heard of to be his national security adviser or deputy national security adviser and bring some of that what we&#8217;re talking about some of that resistance to the U.S. military establishment and ministry, military industrial complex? It might be feasible.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Yes, I mean, the question is always do those people understand the bureaucracy well enough? I mean, the reason that Cheney was so dastardly effective, and that Bolton is only as effective is because they understand the bureaucracy. I think what I would hope is that I think there are more people on the periphery of the kind of Clinton/Obama foreign policy where I think of someone like Rob Malley, for instance —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Yes, who has been on the show. He&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Yeah, who now runs the International Crisis Group, you know, who I think were more willing to kind of step back and think differently. One of the issues that I think you know, is important to think about and to recognize here is, you know, if you read a book like &#8220;The Best and the Brightest,&#8221; Halberstam&#8217;s famous, you know, kind of book about Vietnam. One of the things that he points out is that a whole a whole group of scholars who really understood Asia were basically exiled from American government, because of their position on China during the McCarthy era. And that prevented the kind of internal conversation about Vietnam that was desperately necessary in the mid 1960s.</p>\n<p>I think one of the things that has happened on American policy towards the Middle East, is that because of the kind of rigid lines that have been drawn around the debate over Israel, there is, there&#8217;s a group of people, I think, I would think, put Stephen Walt, in this category, I would put Charles Freeman in this category series of people. And Malley was virtually in this category, he couldn&#8217;t get a job at the beginning of the Obama administration, who would be very valuable for their expertise on other things, but essentially, because they ran afoul of the Israel consensus, haven&#8217;t really been able to have a significant role in foreign policy in general.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>I&#8217;m going to come back to the Israel consensus in a moment, just while we&#8217;re on the subject of staffing and people. I mean, you could also go to some of the newer members of Congress. You look at someone like Ro Khana who has made some amazing moves on foreign policy in terms of war in Yemen, in terms of, you know, even speaking out on Venezuela when there&#8217;s a strong consensus to intervene in Venezuela, to recognize Juan Guaido as president, he&#8217;s come out on that. I mean, someone like Ro Khana, why couldn&#8217;t he be appointed to State Department position?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>I think you&#8217;re right.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>A fresh voice.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>And I think he&#8217;s, I think he&#8217;s really doing a lot of the most interesting and kind of serious rethinking that exists among Democrats in Congress on these issues right now. Chris Murphy, I think it&#8217;s someone else who&#8217;s been doing some good work.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>I mean, they&#8217;ve done amazing work on Yemen. Pete Buttigieg who of course, served in the military as he constantly reminds us. Mayor Pete, he gave a big foreign policy speech on Tuesday night. As we were preparing for the show, I was kind of joking with my producer saying, you know, we&#8217;re doing this show on how the Democrats don&#8217;t talk about foreign policy Sod&#8217;s Law, Pete Buttigieg is giving a big speech on foreign policy. And you&#8217;ve written about his speech for The Forward. I looked at the speech before we started recording, just the transcript.</p>\n<p>When you look at the speech, though, it&#8217;s kind of underwhelming, he lays out five major foreign policy proposals: repeal and replace the 9/11 AUMF, the authorization for the use of military force, which has been used to justify all sorts of wars over the last 18 years, don&#8217;t allow U.S. aid money to be used by the Israelis to annex the West Bank and Gaza, the occupied Palestinian territories, to rejoin the Paris Climate Change Agreement, to rejoin the Iran Nuclear Deal, and to invest in green energy. Now, those are all well and good. But I think you would agree with me when I say they&#8217;re pretty low bars to cross to say, I&#8217;m going to rejoin international agreements that Obama joined that then Trump pulled us out of. It&#8217;s not exactly hugely ambitious, is it?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>No, it&#8217;s not. I mean, it&#8217;s look, it&#8217;s all sensible. And certainly, a huge relief from Trump. And I think that there are, you know, there were a lot of to use American baseball, you know, he hit a lot of singles in that speech. But what I don&#8217;t think he did was try to make bigger and more structural changes. And to think you know, if you&#8217;re going to say, for instance, on the Israel question that you don&#8217;t want American money to be used to annex settlements, then why don&#8217;t you say, but you don&#8217;t want American money to be used to support settlements at all? Since surely, the problem is that the settlements exist, rather than simply that Israel might formalize its control.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Also, you want to get applause for saying we&#8217;re not going to fund violations of international law? Bravo. I mean, what a low bar. Obviously, you couldn&#8217;t fund the annexation of the West Bank. That&#8217;s a war crime.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Right, and, you know, and beyond that, I feel like it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s one thing to say we should rejoin the Iran Nuclear Deal, of course, but I think that, again, what he didn&#8217;t do was talk about a question of what&#8217;s the value of all these sanctions we have on Iran? Which are causing a, you know, hugely damaging effect to the people of Iran and undermining its ability to be the long, the pro-American, liberal democracy we want or even for that matter, North Korea, I mean, I&#8217;m waiting for a Democrat to come and say, look, the emperor has no clothes. The North Koreans have nuclear weapons. They&#8217;re never going to give up their nuclear weapons. And the massive sanctions we are putting on this monstrous regime are simply making the realities for their people even worse and we need to move towards reconciliation.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>But that requires questioning the underlying premises of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, which is North Korea denuclearization, which, as you say, is absurd. They&#8217;re not going to give up nuclear weapons anytime soon, or ever. That requires questioning the premise of yes, we support Israel right and wrong, even when they&#8217;re violating international law in the occupied territories. And on Iran, as you say, you know, okay, we&#8217;re not going to ditch the Iran Nuclear Deal but we still think Iran is the enemy. And remember Obama&#8217;s line, which used to always annoy the hell out of me. He always used to say &#8220;All options on the table,&#8221; which, you know, why can&#8217;t a candidate say actually no, I have no military plan for Iran right now. You know, if Iran were to attack us, obviously, we would deal with it then. But right now, I have no plans during my presidency to go to war with Iran. How about raising the bar a little more than just saying I&#8217;ll rejoin the nuclear deal?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Right. Right. You know, and even the fact that you use the word war, you know, one of the things that, again, foreign policy is so euphemistic linguistically in the United States, you know, that ones always talking about, you know, military intervention or assertive action or muscular foreign policy, right. When you put it more boldly, it becomes in some ways clear how absurd it is which is that there&#8217;s no, absolutely no reason that we should be going to war with Iran, absent them actually, in some way, which is very hard to imagine actually attacking the United States.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>You wrote a piece last week for The Forward headlined &#8220;Thirteen Democrats Recorded Messages About Israel. Only One Spoke with Courage.&#8221; Who was that one? And what was wrong with the other 12 presidential candidate messages?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>So, that was Bernie Sanders. You know, this was a speech to the American Jewish Committee, and I think the American Jewish Committee is exactly the kind of American, established American Jewish group, which really needs Democrats to say, you know, we support Israel. We believe in the principles of Israel&#8217;s Declaration of Independence. We believe that Israel is profoundly violating those principles in ways that are devastating to Palestinians. And we are going to try to take action to change that. And instead, that would have been an act of courage because that crowd doesn&#8217;t usually hear that kind of thing. And only Sanders did. The rest of them were extraordinarily weak and euphemistic, and at times even dishonest in, you know, including, again, candidates who I admire in other realms. And I, again, my fear is that, especially on this issue, they just want to take the path of least resistance and focus on other things. And I think that will mean —</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>On the least resistance path, you&#8217;re one of the country&#8217;s best known Jewish American political journalists. Bernie Sanders would be the first Jewish American presidential candidate if he wins these primaries. Is it because he is Jewish that he feels he can maybe push the boundaries a little bit more than others on this debate, without being accused of anti-Semitism?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Perhaps a little bit. I think, again, it also matters immensely, that he has advisors like Matt Duss, who are deeply invested in this issue and have worked with him on this issue. I mean, Jewish or not, there&#8217;s no question that I think elements of the organized American Jewish community, if they see Sanders emerging from this, in this field, are going to rally very, very strongly against him for any almost any of his opponents.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That would be amazing. I mean, think about that the first Jewish American presidential candidate, and he won&#8217;t have the support of the organized American Jewish Committees because of his position on Israel.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Right, because the organized American Jewish Committee in many ways is quite very distinct ideologically from the actual mass of American Jews. But I, you know, in my experience with a lot of politicians, and frankly, this goes for a lot of journalists too, non-Jewish, maybe some Jewish too, but especially non-Jewish, they see this whole Israel debate as basically walking blindfolded through a minefield. And what they want is just to be able to get through to the other side of the minefield without being blown up. And that encourages you to take the most tentative cautious positions, and rather than the ones that actually accord with your own values.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Although having said that, just be fair to these Democratic presidential candidates, a lot of them have, as you&#8217;ve acknowledged, and I have as well, thanks to Netanyahu being such a freakish, right-winger, all these issues, you have people like Beto O&#8217;Rourke coming out and calling him a racist, which I could never imagine a previous American presidential candidate calling an Israeli Prime Minister a racist in that way.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Yes and that does show that there has been a shift inside the party. And a lot of that, I think is you know, Americans tend to often see the rest of the world by analogy, vis a vis the United States. I mean, one of the reasons the anti-Apartheid movement was able to grow so powerful United States was because of the analogy with the Civil Rights Movement. And I think because people see Netanyahu through the analogy of Trump that has emboldened them a bit. If they can call Trump a racist, then why not call Netanyahu a racist. He&#8217;s the Israeli Trump.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Especially when they&#8217;ve allied together and it&#8217;s no longer a bipartisan issue in the way it was. Just before we run out of time, you talked about a shift. Can we talk about your own shift, your own journey, your own evolution on some of these foreign policy issues? Because some might say you were part of this Blob that Ben Rhodes and others have talked about his foreign policy centrist view of the world. You were editor of the center left New Republic Magazine that all of the establishment Democrats love to read. You were pro the Iraq War in 2003. You even wrote a book about the war on terror, I think called &#8220;The Good Fight&#8221; back in 2006. You were a liberal hawk, weren&#8217;t you? What changed?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>I think, you know, I thought a lot about this. My second book, &#8220;The Icarus Syndrome&#8221; was really about this. It&#8217;s about hubris in American foreign policy. I think for me, it had to do with a series of events that I witnessed coming out of college. First, the Gulf War, then Bosnia and Kosovo in the mid 1990s, which were immensely influential for liberal hawks. And I think, which led again, along with this notion that the 1990s were an end of history, along with America becoming the singular global power and the end of the budget deficit that led to a kind of culture of hubris that I was very, very much a part of that existed on the eve of 9/11. And then when 9/11 happened and the sense of righteous indignation, was married with this hubris about America&#8217;s military, and the kind of the American power and about American wisdom to intervene and remake other countries. It was, in retrospect, a really toxic combination. But unfortunately, it took me seeing the disaster of that war and seeing the effect it had even on people close to me, who suffered as a result of it to be able to recognize that in retrospect.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>And I&#8217;ve got to ask one last question. We can&#8217;t have this discussion about foreign policy in the Democratic president without asking this question. How bad a president on foreign policy would Joe Biden be?</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>It&#8217;s a little hard to tell because Biden has been all over the place on foreign policy, but I think that, you know, there were times where his view, kind of, was actually a little bit more minimalist than Obama&#8217;s. But I fear that it would be — I mean, look, I think it will be very much probably a return to Obama. And yet, I think Obama in his heart probably wanted to go further in reconsidering things and just couldn&#8217;t because of the political limitations. And I fear that Obama [sic] will be a return to the Obama-era. Certainly, it will be much better than Trump, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll have the fundamental reckoning that we really need to have.</p>\n<p><b>MH:</b> Much better than Trump is a very low bar, sadly. That&#8217;s what I worry about, that we&#8217;re going to kind of give these people a pass because anyone is better than Donald Trump. But Joe Biden, in terms of the field we&#8217;ve been talking about, obviously, he&#8217;s the only candidate running who voted for the Iraq War. He still calls himself a personal friend of Benjamin Netanyahu, you know, some of his dealings in Ukraine are now catching all sorts of news attention. I just worry how bad a president would he be? I take your point that he was minimalist on some issues like Afghanistan. But really if we&#8217;re going to talk about changing foreign policy, surely he&#8217;s the candidate who&#8217;s least likely to change anything on this front.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>Yes, I think that&#8217;s exactly right. I mean, again, if we&#8217;re looking for a fundamental rethinking, which I think America very badly needs, because we&#8217;re now basically acting in a series of extremely reckless ways with power which we don&#8217;t even have anymore. You know, and it&#8217;s just a matter of time until other countries around the world start calling our bluff in ways that I think will be very, very painful for Americans and we really need to try to get ahead of that. And I agree, I think Biden is probably the least likely to do that.</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>Peter, we&#8217;ll have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining me on Deconstructed.</p>\n<p><b>PB: </b>My pleasure, thanks.</p>\n<p>[Music interlude.]</p>\n<p><b>MH: </b>That was Peter Beinart, contributing editor at The Atlantic, senior economist at The Forward discussing U.S. foreign policy and whether these Democratic presidential candidates are up to the challenge, the huge challenge of breaking with the U.S. foreign policy consensus, breaking with the hawks, breaking with the people who want it to be business as usual, who want to go back to a pre-Trump era, which wasn&#8217;t very good to begin with.</p>\n<p>I think he and I both agree that Bernie Sanders has clearly kind of set out his stall on foreign policy. He could still go much further, but at least he&#8217;s asking big questions, taking some stands, the other 23 candidates, not so much. A little bit of Warren, a little bit of Buttigieg. Biden, disastrous on this issue, in my view, Iraq war hawk. What are the rest of them going to do? And what are we going to do in terms of pressuring these candidates to talk about foreign policy? What are we as journalists going to do to talk more clearly about all of the human rights abuses that the U.S. has been complicit in?

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Last week,</u> we learned that the Food and Drug Administration had detected <a href="https://theintercept.com/collections/bad-chemistry/">PFAS compounds</a> in pineapple, sweet potato, meat, and chocolate cake. The presence of the industrial compounds in our food was made public by the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2019/06/fda-tests-confirm-suspicions-about-pfas-chemicals-food">Environmental Working Group</a> after a staff member of the <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/health/2019/06/03/fda-high-levels-pfas-chocolate-cake/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> took photos of the research at a scientific conference in Europe.</p>\n<p>While the FDA fields questions about why it didn’t present this information to the public itself (the agency released the data along with a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fdas-scientific-work-understand-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-food-and-findings">statement</a> on Tuesday), it has become clear that 3M, the company that originally developed PFOS and PFOA, had known for a very long time that these toxic and persistent chemicals were in our food.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6151162-3M-Food-2001.html">2001 study</a> sponsored by 3M, 12 samples of food from around the country — including ground beef, bread, apples, and green beans — tested positive for either PFOA or PFOS. One piece of bread had 14,700 parts per trillion of PFOA, though the report noted that the sample was considered “suspect.”</p>\n<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has known about the study for years, but it is not clear if the FDA was aware of the research. The Environmental Working Group mentioned the 3M study in a <a href="https://static.ewg.org/files/EWGCDCpetition2002.pdf">2002 report</a> on PFAS chemicals and alerted the Centers for Disease Control.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, attorney Rob Bilott wrote to the FDA to ask “the extent to which FDA was aware of the data collected on behalf of the 3M company in 2001 that confirmed elevated levels of PFAS in the U.S. food supply.” In 1999, Bilott <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/08/17/teflon-toxin-case-against-dupont/">sued DuPont</a> over PFOA contamination around its plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia, where the company used the chemical to make Teflon. Through his litigation, he acquired many documents about PFAS, which he has since supplied to the EPA, FDA, and other federal agencies.</p>\n<p>The EPA did not respond to questions about when exactly it became aware of the 3M study. 3M provided the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2001, 3M published the Multi-City Food Study and we shared this report with the EPA within seven days. This report is one of thousands of documents we have placed in the public domain related to the study of PFAS chemistries. We will continue to engage with members of our communities, elected officials and regulators to share information about these chemistries.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tuesday’s FDA statement noted that recent tests “did not detect PFAS in the vast majority of the foods tested.” The statement also said that “based on the best available current science, the FDA does not have any indication that these substances are a human health concern, in other words a food safety risk in human food, at the levels found in this limited sampling.”</p>\n<p>Yet there is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos">abundant evidence</a> that even at very low levels, both chemicals interfere with human immunity, reproduction, and development, and cause multiple health problems, including elevated cholesterol, thyroid disease, and cancer. Virtually everyone has some PFAS chemicals in their blood. They enter the body through food, water, dust, and exposure to consumer products.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>There are several possible ways the industrial chemicals enter food supplies, including contaminated groundwater and through <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos">sewage sludge</a>, which has been spread on crops around the country for decades.</p>\n<p>New research presented at a PFAS <a href="https://pfasproject.com/2019/02/05/2019-pfas-conference/">conference</a> at Northeastern University this week suggests other impacts of the chemicals, including increased <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6151230-Hospitalizations.html">hospitalizations</a> of children for infectious diseases; reduced <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6151229-Renal-Function.html">kidney function</a>; and changes in hormone levels at birth and during childhood<strong>. </strong>A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6151226-Africa-Study.html">study</a> done in West Africa on the relation between PFAS levels on the effect of the measles vaccine added to evidence that the chemicals interfere with childhood immunity and weaken the effect of vaccines. Another <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6151233-Diet-PFAS.html">study</a> from Harvard Medical School’s Department of Population Medicine found that high PFAS levels were associated with a diet high in low-fiber carbohydrates, fish, and high-fat meat.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 13, 2019</strong></p>\n<p><em>This article has been updated with a statement from 3M.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/12/3m-pfas-chemicals-food/">3M Knew About PFAS Food Contamination in 2001</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Operatives at a</u> controversial cybersecurity firm working for the United Arab Emirates government discussed targeting The Intercept and breaching the computers of its employees, according to two sources, including a member of the hacking team who said they were present at a meeting to plan for such an attack.</p>\n<p>The firm, DarkMatter, brought ex-National Security Agency hackers and other U.S. intelligence and military veterans together with Emirati analysts to compromise the computers of political dissidents at home and abroad, including American citizens, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">revealed</a> in January. The news agency also reported that the FBI is investigating DarkMatter’s use of American hacking expertise and the possibility that it was wielded against Americans.</p>\n<p>The campaign against dissidents and critics of the Emirati government, code-named Project Raven, began in Baltimore. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/24/darkmatter-united-arab-emirates-spies-for-hire/">A 2016 Intercept article</a> by reporter Jenna McLaughlin revealed how the Maryland-based computer security firm CyberPoint assembled a team of Americans for a contract to hone UAE&#8217;s budding hacking and surveillance capabilities, leaving some recruits unsettled. Much of the CyberPoint team was later poached by DarkMatter, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government and headquartered just two floors from the Emirati equivalent of the NSA, the National Electronic Security Authority (which later became the Signals Intelligence Agency). One of McLaughlin’s sources described the episode as something of a &#8220;hostile takeover&#8221; by the UAE government. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/21/deep-pockets-deep-cover-the-uae-is-paying-ex-cia-officers-to-build-a-spy-empire-in-the-gulf/">A subsequent story by McLaughlin  for Foreign Policy</a> detailed how American spies at DarkMatter had been crucial in building the UAE’s intelligence apparatus. The NESA would go on to become Project Raven’s primary “client,” responsible for handing down groups and organizations to be targeted and compromised.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;When the article hit, it mentioned DarkMatter, so we had to tiger team a response.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>According to the hacking team source, who discussed the episode on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak to the press, the 2016 reporting revealing the connection between DarkMatter and the Emirati government made The Intercept a target. “When [McLaughlin’s first] article hit, it mentioned DarkMatter, so we had to tiger team a response to that,” said the source, using jargon for a specialized response group. “Any time NESA or DarkMatter had any media, we would get pulled in to develop target lists.”</p>\n<p>Project Raven monitored the internet for mentions of DarkMatter, said Jonathan Cole, an ex-Raven employee who worked in targeting, to make sure that the public-facing cybersecurity company’s name wasn’t attached to the work being done by its hackers on behalf of the NESA. “When an article like this would come out, [the client] would be very upset,” the source added, referring to the NESA.</p>\n<p>The Emirati consulate did not return a request for comment about NESA&#8217;s relationship with DarkMatter or allegations of targeting American citizens.</p>\n<p>A second person familiar with the matter confirmed discussions about targeting The Intercept, saying the talks included Marc Baier, a top American DarkMatter executive formerly with the NSA. This person did not say if the discussions led to a decision.</p>\n<p>Following several news reports tying DarkMatter to Emirati government surveillance, DarkMatter chief financial officer Samer Khalife moved some Americans from DarkMatter to a new company, Connection Systems, according to the second source, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The purpose of the new company was to create the appearance that DarkMatter no longer conducted surveillance and cyberoperations on behalf of the Emirati government — but Khalife installed his brother as the company’s nominal boss, this person said. Connection Systems today employs multiple former DarkMatter staffers, according to LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Neither Khalife nor Baier responded to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>It is not clear if an attack against The Intercept was ever carried out. The Intercept was unable to find evidence of an attack by DarkMatter on its computers. But the targeting would have happened in 2016, so it’s possible that malicious messages were rejected by a spam filter or discarded in the intervening years.</p>\n<p>A third source familiar with Project Raven, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to discuss their work, said they were not aware of any attempt to target The Intercept or its employees, and that it was unlikely a coordinated attack of that sort could have been attempted by DarkMatter’s resident NESA hackers without attracting the attention of their American counterparts. Still, this source noted that the covert targeting of an American publication by Emirati nationals was technically possible.</p>\n<p>Other ex-Project Raven members contacted by The Intercept declined to comment, some citing the FBI investigation. The FBI declined to comment.</p>\n<p>In an email to The Intercept, DarkMatter’s marketing chief Priscilla Dunn said the company “rejects” the claim that it targeted The Intercept in retaliation for prior coverage. Dunn declined to specifically deny that this discussion took place and refused to comment on the existence of Project Raven or the company’s collaboration with the NESA, providing instead the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our work in cyber security is single-mindedly focused on defensive capabilities. Our values and principles call for us to have the highest impact on the societies and economies we serve.</p>\n<p>We develop our own intellectual property and partner with vetted global-technology companies and the government to develop cybersecurity products, solutions and services that are all in public view on our website.</p>\n<p>Cyber security is still a relatively young field and the discussion around it is increasingly polarized. DarkMatter wants to be part of this discussion and has been a leading voice in the media and in forums on how to build cyber resilient societies, economies and institutions.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1000px;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-254499" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/UAE-Aldar-HQ-nogrid-2-1560286058-1000x641.png" alt="UAE-Aldar-HQ-nogrid-2-1560286058" /></p>\n<p class="caption">Aldar HQ office building where DarkMatter has their headquarters.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo illustration: Soohee Cho/The Intercept, Getty Images</p></div>\n<h3>Planning and Execution</h3>\n<p>The hacking team source said that they did not participate in any attempt to hack The Intercept, but were present in a conference room inside Project Raven’s Abu Dhabi headquarters when the attack was discussed. According to the source, others in the room included Al Anood Al Kaabi and Fatema Mohammed Al Shehhi, two NESA analysts; and Ryan Adams, the team’s American operations director, a U.S. Air Force veteran. None responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>“Literally, the guidance to us as the target developers was, ‘Here’s the article, find the people responsible, find the people pushing it around, that’s your target list — go,’” the source said.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>&#8220;The guidance was, ‘Here’s the article, find the people responsible — go.’&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>According to the hacking team source and Cole, target lists drawn up by individual Project Raven analysts in response to a news article typically included not only the article&#8217;s author, but also potentially others connected to that person, including anyone who might have contributed to, edited, or even shared the article. Counterattacks against negative mentions of the Emirati government — and the NESA in particular — cast a “pretty wide net,” said the hacking team source, sometimes sweeping up not only an article’s author, but also the “author’s boyfriend, girlfriend, or brother … two or three hops out” from the original target. The idea was to hack anyone who might be communicating with the target, Cole said, and to “go get anyone you can to get a foothold in this organization” in order to spy on their sources, as the source put it. Compiling an actual target list would be up to individual Project Raven analysts.</p>\n<p>After the target list was set, the next step would have involved the execution of a text, social media, and email spearphishing campaign by NESA analysts “trying to quiet the issue or redirect attention” away from the negative article.</p>\n<p>Phishing messages are designed to trick the recipient into taking some action, and in national security cases at DarkMatter typically involved trying to get them to open malicious documents in common formats like PDF, RTF, and Microsoft Word, which would be sent by email, according to Cole.</p>\n<p>Such attacks were conducted after scouting for an individual’s digital weaknesses, according to the hacking team source and Cole. “When you did your target research, [that included] the basics about a person, their technical footprint, any social media accounts, any selectors, mobile, email, social handles, things like that,” said the hacking team source. Once a target’s online life was mapped, “you could pair those with [computer] exploits” from DarkMatter’s “in-house exploit inventory.” If the client “really wanted them bad,” Project Raven would purchase exploits from a third party, including so-called zero day software vulnerabilities, or those that have yet to be identified by the software’s maker. Such attacks are particularly dangerous and difficult to guard against. If opened, such exploits could have granted persistent access to the target’s computer.</p>\n<p>According to Cole, trying to breach a journalist was typically a means to an end rather than an attempt to damage the journalist themselves. “If someone from The Intercept was talking to a [national security] target,” Cole explained, “you could go after an Intercept account” in order to get to that national security objective. Project Raven hackers would often work to build a rapport with a target by posing as a potential source or supporter through initial messages, only later springing the trap. “Once you elicit trust, you can inject a [malicious] document into the chain,” said Cole. “It’s more probable someone will open an exploit if you&#8217;ve established communications in safe manner.”</p>\n<p>If targets traveled to the UAE, Project Raven would take advantage of their proximity, at times going so far as to break into a target’s room, explained the hacking team source: “If they&#8217;re in country we just go to the service provider and say, ‘Hey, we need … access,’ [or] poison their wireless access at a hotel.” This source said that Project Raven tasked members of the Emirati State Security Department to “dress up as cable guys, do fake repairs, be in a hotel where you needed to be, swap out your laptop charger for one that looks similar” in order to compromise a target’s devices.</p>\n<p>Project Raven’s practice of targeting journalists, American or otherwise, was disclosed in the Reuters report, which mentioned the presence of “three &#8230; American names on the hidden targeting queue” at DarkMatter in Abu Dhabi. These names have yet to be identified. According to the report, &#8220;One of [DarkMatter’s] key targets in 2012 was Rori Donaghy &#8230; a British journalist and activist who authored articles critical of the country’s human rights record.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1000px;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-254488" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/UAE-villa-screenshot-nogrid-1560283454-1000x642.png" alt="UAE-villa-screenshot-nogrid-1560283454" /></p>\n<p class="caption">NESA analysts and DarkMatter personnel discussed targeting The Intercept at a property in this neighborhood of Abu Dhabi’s Khalifa City, a private residential suburb whose rental villas are popular among business executives and expats.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo illustration: Soohee Cho/The Intercept, Google Map</p></div>\n<h3>The Americans</h3>\n<p>The hacking team source said that although they personally refused to help target U.S. individuals and organizations, that work ended up being done one way or another. “Unfortunately when you generate a target list and you’re working with a small tiger team, I can say all day long that I’m not working that person that’s on the list, but then it’s just given to the next person on the team,” the source said. The prevailing feeling, they added, would be “the client fucking wants this now, we need to do it. The client doesn&#8217;t care what the citizenship is.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;The client fucking wants this now, we need to do it. The client doesn’t care what the citizenship is.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>Cole, who worked on similar operations against non-U.S. targets, said he had no involvement in or firsthand knowledge of efforts to hack Americans or American computer systems, but recalled being warned about these efforts by a concerned American co-worker at the time. Cole also said he worried Americans were being targeted by the American-aided hackers, despite assurances from above that any information on U.S. citizens vacuumed into the group’s central repository of hacked data was accidental. Cole says he now believes such collection was deliberate, and that Project Raven’s leadership falsely claimed that the U.S. government was informed of any incidental surveillance of Americans and that such data was routinely purged from DarkMatter computers. “I suspected that for a while,” he told The Intercept. “I was raising the flag in monitoring for that specific thing. The understanding was [collected American data] was being communicated back to the U.S. intelligence agencies. That’s what we were led to believe, but we found out later that was a fallacy.” Files from American sources that Cole&#8217;s managers promised him they would delete wound up sticking around. “There was always different rationales and excuses,” Cole said, when a promised purge of American data failed to materialize. “I was told one thing and observed another.”</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>Also worrying, according to Cole, was the shifting role of Americans in Project Raven. They were ostensibly present in DarkMatter’s Abu Dhabi villa for training purposes. In practice, for legal reasons, that meant they sometimes gave very specific directions under the guidelines that they could do “everything but hands on the keyboard,” as Cole put it, “providing the steps and instructions” for hacking the NESA’s targets worldwide without actually executing any of the steps. “However,” Cole explained, “that translated into very little. … It got to the point where nobody was around to train, so we were just doing it [all].” According to the second source familiar with DarkMatter’s discussions about targeting The Intercept, questions of legality have been a perennial worry across DarkMatter, even when U.S. citizens aren’t the explicit target; breaking into the Facebook or Gmail accounts of noncitizens still means potentially breaching servers residing in the United States. The source added that Khalife, DarkMatter&#8217;s CFO, has in the past discouraged American employees from obtaining compliance under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, a regulatory regime governing the sale of American military goods and services.</p>\n<p>The Reuters report said the NSA was not involved in DarkMatter’s day-to-day operations but “approved of and was regularly briefed on Raven’s activities.”</p>\n<p>Initiatives to target journalists were just one of the many ways in which Americans were hacked or surveilled by Project Raven, Cole and the source on the hacking team said. Wired magazine, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch were likely targeted by Project Raven hackers at the behest of Emirati clientele such as the NESA, they told The Intercept, but could not recall details.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/12/darkmatter-uae-hack-intercept/">Team of American Hackers and Emirati Spies Discussed Attacking The Intercept</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Twelve jurors walked</u> into the federal courthouse in Tucson, Arizona, Tuesday afternoon with a problem. Two weeks after the U.S. government began to argue its case in the prosecution of Scott Warren, a border-based humanitarian aid volunteer accused of two counts of felony harboring and one count of conspiracy, the jurors could not come to a unanimous decision as to whether he was innocent or guilty.</p>\n<p>The previous afternoon, the jurors had sent a letter to District Judge Raner Collins, informing him that they were deadlocked. Collins ordered them to go back and try again. By Tuesday, they were still stuck. Eight jurors believed Warren was innocent on all counts. Four believed he was guilty. They sent Collins another note, and, at 1:33 p.m., they reentered his courtroom. The judge asked the jurors if they all believed that further deliberation would fail to yield a unanimous decision. On that point, they were all in agreement: The jury was hung.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="immigrants" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>“I want to thank you for your time and your attention,” Collins said, and with that, he dismissed the jurors, and one of the most important trials involving humanitarian aid on the U.S.-Mexico border in recent memory came to an end.</p>\n<p>Nineteen months after his arrest, Warren’s case had drawn international attention and outrage, with United Nations human rights experts and advocacy organizations from around the world decrying the prosecution as a blatant attack on humanitarian aid in a region where thousands of migrants have died — and continue to die — in the desert.</p>\n<p>Despite the mistrial, the government has not dropped the charges against Warren, a 36-year-old geographer from Ajo, Arizona. The possibility of a retrial is still alive, with Warren facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all counts and sentenced to consecutive terms. A status meeting in the case is scheduled for early July.</p>\n<p>“The government put on its best case with the full force of countless resources, and 12 jurors could not agree with that case,” defense attorney Greg Kuykendall told reporters Tuesday. “Scott Warren remains innocent as a legal and as a factual matter, because the jury could not conclude otherwise,” he added. “We remain devoted today in our commitment to defend Scott’s lifelong devotion to providing humanitarian aid.”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254572" src="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/ajo-barn-water-1560305693.jpg" alt="Humanitarian aid shelter in Ajo, known to groups as &quot;The Barn&quot; and the location where Dr. Warren was taken into custody by CBP." /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">Water and other assorted goods outside the Barn, a humanitarian aid shelter in Ajo, Arizona.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Laura Saunders for The Intercept</p></div>\n<p>Warren was arrested on January 17, 2018, at a humanitarian aid facility in Ajo known as the Barn, some 40 miles above the border, in one of the deadliest stretches of the Sonoran Desert for migrants making their way north. Owing to a Clinton-era border strategy known as Prevention Through Deterrence, which intentionally funnels migrants into the most dangerous areas of the desert and remains the foundation of modern American border enforcement to this day, a minimum of 3,000 people have died in the Arizona borderlands — though the true total is guaranteed to be higher.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Warren began building bridges between humanitarian groups in southern Arizona, an effort to focus aid work — including the delivery of food and water, and search and recovery operations — in an area where the effects of Prevention Through Deterrence have been particularly brutal: the so-called West Desert, also known as the Ajo corridor. In the years that followed, these volunteers directly contributed to a historic increase in the number of human remains and bodies recovered in the region.</p>\n<p>On the morning of Warren’s arrest, one of the groups Warren volunteers with, the faith-based organization No More Deaths, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/17/u-s-border-patrol-systematically-destroyed-water-supplies-left-for-migrants-in-desert-report-says/">published</a> a detailed report implicating the Border Patrol in the destruction of jugs containing thousands of gallons of water left for migrants crossing the desert over multiple years. The report included video evidence. Hours after it was published, a pair of plainclothes Border Patrol agents set up a surveillance post across from the Barn. There they spotted Warren with two individuals they suspected were undocumented.</p>\n<p>“Toncs at the barn,” agent Brendan Burns <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/30/were-gonna-take-everyone-border-patrol-targets-prominent-humanitarian-group-as-criminal-organization/">wrote</a> in a group text, using Border Patrol slang for migrants; some believe it refers to the sound a flashlight makes when it connects with a human skull.</p>\n<p>The “toncs” Burns referred to were 23-year-old Kristian Perez-Villanueva, of El Salvador, and 20-year-old José Arnaldo Sacaria-Goday, of Honduras. The pair had left their countries separately. Perez-Villanueva hoped to seek asylum. Sacaria-Goday was homeless. They were strangers when they met in a Mexican border town. They became close and crossed the border together. They spent two nights in the desert, where they were chased by immigration agents and tossed their backpacks and supplies, including their food.</p>\n<p>Backed up by a caravan of law enforcement vehicles, the agents in the wash descended on the Barn and placed Warren and the two young men under arrest. The following month, Warren was indicted by a grand jury. While Warren was released on his own recognizance after a night in Border Patrol custody, Perez-Villanueva and Sacaria-Goday were not. The government detained the pair as material witnesses in its case for several weeks, then deported them once their depositions were taken.</p>\n<p>As The Intercept reported in a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/04/no-more-deaths-scott-warren-migrants-border-arizona/">yearlong investigation</a> published in May, Warren’s felony case was the culmination of an escalating law enforcement crackdown against humanitarian volunteers in southern Arizona that began <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/17/arizona-border-patrol-raid-surveillance-no-more-deaths-humanitarian-immigration/">shortly after</a> President Donald Trump’s inauguration.</p>\n<p>Warren was also <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/no-more-deaths-arizona-border-littering-charges-immigration/">one of nine</a> No More Deaths volunteers hit with federal misdemeanor littering charges in 2017 for leaving food, water, and other humanitarian aid supplies on a federal wildlife reserve outside Ajo, where migrants routinely die. The <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/01/17/no-more-deaths-border-documents-trial/">first trial</a> in those cases, held in January, resulted in four No More Deaths volunteers convicted and sentenced to 15 months of probation and ordered to pay $250 in fines. A second group of volunteers facing misdemeanor charges accepted similar consequences days later, and the charges against them were formally dismissed.</p>\n<p>Warren’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/14/no-more-deaths-trial-migrant-bodies-border/">misdemeanor trial</a> was held last month. Judge Collins has yet to issue a decision in that case.</p>\n<p>Following the jury’s dismissal Tuesday, Warren’s friends and family filtered out into the hallway on the fifth floor of the courthouse, many unclear on what would happen next.</p>\n<p>“Scott wanted to resume his life,” Mark Warren, Scott&#8217;s father, told The Intercept. “This has been the focus of Scott’s life for such a long time now, and it’s all encompassing. It’s not like it’s just something that’s happening to me over here — it’s everything.”</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>As Warren’s family and supporters awaited new information, Kuykendall and his co-counsel, Amy Knight, were given the rare opportunity to speak with the jurors about the case at length. The defense attorneys told The Intercept they left the conversation with the impression that the deliberations in the case were serious and the jurors’ recaps of the process were specific.</p>\n<p>When Warren stepped out of the courthouse Tuesday afternoon, he was greeted by a throng of press, friends, and supporters. Standing before the cameras and microphones, he immediately addressed the issues that matter to him most. “Since my arrest in January 2018, at least 88 bodies were recovered from the Ajo corridor of the Arizona desert. We know that’s a minimum number and that many more are out there and have not been found,” Warren told the crowd. “The government’s plan, in the midst of this humanitarian crisis? Policies to target undocumented people, refugees, and their families; prosecutions to criminalize humanitarian aid, kindness, and solidarity.”</p>\n<p>As he wrapped up his brief remarks, Warren turned his focus to the people who have supported him and to the people who have been lost from his story. “I’ve received enormous support from family, friends, lawyers, and my community. Thank you to everyone, and I want to say that I love you all very, very much,” he said. “The other men that were arrested with me that day, José Sacaria-Goday and Kristian Perez-Villanueva, have not received the attention and outpouring of support that I have. I do not know how they are doing now, but I desperately hope that they are safe.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/12/felony-trial-of-no-more-deaths-volunteer-scott-warren-ends-in-mistrial/">Felony Trial of No More Deaths Volunteer Scott Warren Ends in Mistrial</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

This week on Intercepted: In a bombshell series of reports, The Intercept Brasil has revealed dirty tricks used in the prosecution of leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on corruption charges and improper coordination among prosecutors and judges. Glenn Greenwald discusses the documents in the leaked archive and what this means for Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. While the 2020 horserace dominates the headlines, local elections for district attorney could have major ramifications for disadvantaged and targeted communities. Tiffany Cabán, a queer Latina public defender from Queens, New York, talks about her battle with the Democratic Party machine in her bid to become a prosecutor opposed to the carceral state. Chesa Boudin, whose parents were sentenced to lengthy prison terms when he was 14-months-old, is trying to overhaul San Francisco’s justice system and radically change the relationship between cops and the DA. He talks about his family story and why he wants to move from public defender to prosecutor. As paramilitary forces carry out a massacre against nonviolent protesters in Sudan, we get a report from filmmaker Hajooj Kuka, who was wounded in the raid in Khartoum last week. And we hear the music of Sudanese-American Ahmed Gallab, the lead singer-songwriter of the band Sinkane, and his experience of monitoring the major developments in his home country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Donald J.

And this is episode 97 of Intercepted.</span></p>\n<p><b>DJT: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The U.S. attorneys, state, local prosecutors, police officers, sheriffs, deputies, and federal agents who keep our country safe — you keep America safe. And you maybe don&#8217;t hear it enough or sometimes don&#8217;t feel it enough. You do an incredible job. The people in this country know it and they love you. Just remember that.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">We have another jam-packed show this week. We&#8217;re going to be talking to two fiery young candidates running to become District Attorneys in major U.S. cities. And they are very unorthodox candidates. We&#8217;re going to be talking to Tiffany Cabán, a queer Latina public defender. She&#8217;s running to become prosecutor in Queens, New York.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tiffany Cabán: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have money, if you know how to game the system, you can do whatever you want in this city.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">We are also going to be talking to Chesa Boudin. He&#8217;s running for district attorney in San Francisco. His parents were both sentenced to lengthy prison terms when he was just 14 months old.</span></p>\n<p><b>Chesa Boudin: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">More than half of Americans have had a family member behind bars. I am one of them.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither of these candidates for district attorney had ever dreamt of becoming prosecutors, but they both say that they plan to take on the prison industrial complex, stop the criminal prosecutions of many drug-related offenses and fight to protect sex workers. One of them is also talking about prosecuting ICE agents who abuse their authority.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are two very fascinating people and they both are talking about issues that seldom make it to prime time in this country. That’s coming up on the program. We&#8217;re also going to be looking at the ongoing horrors coming out of Sudan as paramilitary forces raided an encampment of protesters last week, killing more than 100 people, raping dozens of women and injuring hundreds of others.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hajooj Kuka: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">It was around 5:00 a.m. and then the attacks started. Thousands of Rapid Response Force people with sticks dashing in and just beating everybody else up.</span></p>\n<h3>Glenn Greenwald Discusses the Intercept Brasil&#8217;s Report of Dirty Tricks Used in the Prosecution of Leftist Former President Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva</h3>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">But, we begin in Brazil where The Intercept has just broken a bombshell series of stories about some of the most powerful people in that country. The series of investigative stories is based on messages, conversations, photos, videos, audio recordings and documents exchanged between members of the anti-corruption “Operation Car Wash” task force in Brazil. That was a multi-year anti-corruption investigation in the country that led to the imprisonment of the leftist former president of that country. The conversations included in these stories are part of a massive trove of files sent weeks ago to The Intercept in Brazil by an anonymous source. Now, after receiving these files, Intercept journalists and security specialists analyzed the material, consulted individuals close to members of the “Car Wash” operation, with the goal of verifying dates and private events mentioned in these conversations. And once the authenticity was confirmed, The Intercept Brasil began examining and reporting on that material.</span></p>\n<p><b>Amy Goodman: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">A damning new report by The Intercept reveals the judge overseeing the case that put former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva behind bars likely aided federal prosecutors in their corruption cases against Lula and other high profile Brazilian figures.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">At the heart of these stories are the utterly scandalous revelations that top judicial officials in Brazil conspired to prevent the party of the former left wing president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from winning the presidential election. It was these elections that brought the fascist president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to power. And one of the figures at the center of these new documents obtained by The Intercept is Sérgio  Moro, Bolsanaro’s Justice Minister.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moro was the presiding judge in “Operation Car Wash” and the documents show, in the words of my colleagues, that Moro “unethically collaborated with the Car Wash prosecutors to help design the case against Lula despite serious internal doubts about the evidence supporting the accusations, only for him to then pretend to be its neutral adjudicator.” This reporting is already causing a major controversy in Brazil. The country’s Supreme Court on Monday said that it was going to start a review of an appeal by Lula, the jailed former president.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we go now to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where I am joined by my colleague Glenn Greenwald. He&#8217;s one of the key journalists reporting this story out. Glenn, congrats on this very significant reporting to you and the whole team at Intercept Brasil and thanks for coming back again on Intercepted.</span></p>\n<p><b>Glenn Greenwald: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you, Jeremy. I&#8217;m happy to talk to you about it.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Give us the top line, headline here of what the significance of what you guys have obtained and begun publishing.</span></p>\n<p><b>GG: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, everyone knows there&#8217;s been a lot of political crises in Brazil — the impeachment of the former President Dilma Rousseff, the ascension to the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro — but by far the most significant event over the last five years has been this sweeping corruption probe that has put billionaires and extremely powerful politicians into prison. By far the most significant of which was last year when they put Lula, the two-term highly popular president, into prison at exactly the moment when he was intending to run for president in 2018. And all polls showed him as by far the bleeding front runner. Nobody could have beaten Lula and by convicting and imprisoning Lula, they made him ineligible to run and that&#8217;s what paved the way for Bolsonaro&#8217;s victory.So, it&#8217;s almost impossible to have done anything more significant.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And obviously there was a lot of suspicion that when you remove the front runner for president by putting him into prison, you&#8217;re doing it for political reasons, but you couldn&#8217;t prove it because everything they did was in secret. And so, we got this massive archive of secret documents that includes all their private chats and internal documents.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">When you say you got the internal communications and chats of these people, what people are you talking about?</span></p>\n<p><b>GG:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The people who have led this anti-corruption probe are what&#8217;s called the Carwash Task Force, who are a team of prosecutors led by someone who&#8217;s in his 30s named Deltan Dallagnol has become a huge celebrity and hero in Brazil. And then the most important figure is the judge who has presided over all of these cases and who has been finding everyone guilty and sentencing them to you know, he put Lula in prison for 10 years, Judge Sérgio Moro. And now, after Bolsonaro&#8217;s victory, he made Sérgio Moro, his super justice minister, which obviously looked like a quid pro quo.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, our documents that we got are about Judge Moro, now Minister Moro, and this task force led by Deltan. Internally, they were actively saying that one of their critical goals was to prevent PT from winning the 2018 election. Judge Moro, who was presiding over these cases, and had the same duty as judges in the United States, which is to be neutral, to issue verdicts from a position of impartiality, was in fact doing what people long suspected he was doing, which was not just collaborating with the prosecutors, but basically being the chief of the whole operation — telling them how to construct their cases, how to prosecute the cases, what arguments to make, what arguments not to make.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, he was designing the very criminal accusations that he was then pretending to neutrally adjudicate including the criminal charges against Lula that sent Lula to prison for a decade and removed him from the presidential race — a complete and undeniable violation of every ethical rule that governs what a judge can do. Almost nobody is defending Sérgio Moro who is after Bolsonaro, by far the most powerful figure in Brazil and even with Bolsonaro, by far the most admired one.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Now, Sérgio Moro was on the Time 100 list. There also was just an embarrassingly soft puff interview on 60 Minutes.</span></p>\n<p><b>Anderson Cooper: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">A small band of prosecutors is working long hours in cramped quarters on the biggest investigation Brazil has ever seen, Operation Carwash.</span></p>\n<p><b>AC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> How does Car Wash compare to Watergate?</span></p>\n<p><b>Deltan Dallagnol:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Car Wash is much, much bigger.</span></p>\n<p><b>AC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Deltan Dallagnol is the lead prosecutor.</span></p>\n<p><b>AC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bigger than Watergate?</span></p>\n<p><b>DD:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Much bigger.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Did all of these U.S. news outlets get it wrong in their praise of Sérgio Moro and their characterization of Operation Car Wash?</span></p>\n<p><b>GG:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I, like a lot of people, found it admirable that they were going after the most powerful people and finally putting an end to systemic corruption. But they went very wrong, because the power got to their head, and it turned political, and it became clear that they were only interested after a while, in making sure that PT — the Workers&#8217; Party — was the only one that was destroyed so that the right wing could return to power. And that&#8217;s what these documents show. So, there were good parts of the Car Wash investigation. There still are good parts of it. The problem is that they abuse their celebrity, their unquestioned power, and the power of the state, the power of prosecutors for overtly political ends in a way that makes them just as corrupt as the people who they began imprisoning.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, of course, Jair Bolsonaro, the relatively new president of Brazil, is an extreme right winger, very authoritarian, is waging war on all sorts of vulnerable classes of people in Brazil. What has been the response from the Bolsonaro government to your reporting?</span></p>\n<p><b>GG: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">In general, the most important people who speak for the Bolsonaro government are his three sons, one of whom is a senator, one of whom is a member of the House of Representatives who got elected with the largest vote and one of whom is his sort of informal spokesman who&#8217;s a city councilman in Rio de Janeiro. And they have been relentlessly attacking me, my husband David, who&#8217;s a congressman from a left wing party and The Intercept Brazil just trying to kind of claim that we&#8217;re doing this because we&#8217;re enemies of Brazil. Thus far, though, there&#8217;s been no official response from the Bolsonaro government in the way of, say things we&#8217;re expecting and have been expecting like searches of our office to find out who our source is.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are accusing our source of being a hacker saying he committed grave crimes. Minister Moro himself did respond and he just very arrogantly dismissed the notion that he did anything wrong. He said we took things out of context and sensationalized it, but nobody&#8217;s buying it. So, the tide is really turning against them. So, I think the Bolsonaro government feels very constrained in what they can do, because you just read the conversations between Morro and these prosecutors and there&#8217;s no way to conclude anything other than he egregiously broke every ethical rule that he was limited by and people are really, actually feel betrayed, those who have been supporting him to learn his true character.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I cannot emphasize enough how significant this reporting is in Brazil, and at the same time we have to recognize, doing stories like this in the United States are very dangerous particularly for journalistic sources that they try to throw the book at. And in Brazil, people do get killed, people get killed for challenging established power. What are the threats you&#8217;re potentially facing in the current political context with Bolsonaro in power in Brazil?</span></p>\n<p><b>GG:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> There&#8217;s been under Bolsonaro a series of censorship and prior restraint orders where they&#8217;ve gotten more aggressive, severely more aggressive with trying to censor and suppress reporting. But the biggest danger is that, you know, we&#8217;ve done a lot of reporting about the fact that the Bolsonaro family and the Bolsonaro movement is linked to paramilitary gangs who only know violence, and they kill indiscriminately. As you know, one of our best friends Marielle Franco, the black LGBT woman from the favelas who served on the city council with David was brutally murdered last March. They caught the two police officers who killed her but we still don&#8217;t know who ordered her murder. Her phone and her computer were seized and they found that they had been monitoring mine and David&#8217;s public events along with other left wing journalists and politicians.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, political violence is a real thing here in Brazil, especially if you&#8217;re a journalist. And I mean, I have to say we have a team of mostly young Brazilian editors, journalists, and staff members. I think they&#8217;re all under 40. They are completely vulnerable. I cannot express how courageous they have been in doing this reporting — how unflinching, and aggressive, and professional. And we published four major exposes, you know, 3,000 words each about highly complex matters. There wasn&#8217;t a single error in any of the articles that anybody could point to and it was done in the most aggressive way possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And unlike me, who at least has the protection of being more public and having a husband who&#8217;s a member of Congress, but still faces threats, they face huge amounts of threats.

The Trump show is on 24/7. But for many people living in disadvantaged or targeted communities in this country, the most important elections that could impact their lives on a daily basis are not those involving Congress or the presidency. It&#8217;s those contests that determine who is going to be the prosecutor in your community. Who will be the district attorney? These are extremely powerful people who often have major control over who goes to prison, what crimes should result in jail terms, how long those sentences will be, what do you do with cops who kill people in an extra-judicial way.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They preside over systems where cash bail means that poor people have less constitutional rights than those with money. They are, at times, like dictators presiding over questions of basic liberty. And yet, the vast majority of prosecutors run unopposed in their elections and historically, prosecutors have cozy relationships with the police, with law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in recent years, we&#8217;ve started to see candidates running for district attorney across this country that have a very different track record. And these candidates are not your typical prosecutors. In fact, some of them say that they would never have even thought of being part of a system that locks people up. But running they are. And they say they want to wage war on the way prosecutions have historically been conducted.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re talking about taking on the prison industrial complex, decriminalizing and legalizing recreational drug possession and use. They&#8217;re talking about prosecuting ICE agents who abuse their authority and they&#8217;re talking about alternatives to jail and prison. They say they will go after cops who engage in killings of black and brown people.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And today, we&#8217;re going to be talking with two young candidates seeking to overhaul deeply entrenched, pro-police systems in their cities. In a moment, we&#8217;re going to be joined by Chesa Boudin who is running for DA in San Francisco. But we begin with Tiffany Cabán from Queens, New York.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cabán is a constituent of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and she&#8217;s going to be going up against the same Democratic Party Machine in Queens that AOC defeated with her insurgent grassroots campaign. Coming up very soon – June 25</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in fact – that election is going to be held for District Attorney in Queens. It&#8217;s a crowded race for the huge district of nearly 2.3 million people.</span></p>\n<p><b>Newscaster: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">District Attorney Richard Brown has died. He served as district attorney since 1991.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The DA seat for Queens hasn’t been up for grabs in nearly 30 years, and now there&#8217;s an open seat, as the incumbent passed away in office. Tiffany Cabán is a queer Latina woman who has spent her career fighting against prosecutors. And if she is going to win this race, she will, once again, need to beat the Democratic machine.</span></p>\n<p><b>Tiffany Cabán [campaign ad]: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a queer Latina from a working-class family. People like us are exactly who the system is trying to keep down.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Tiffany Cabán has spent her life as a public defender, representing those in court who could not afford to hire an attorney. Now, she’s decided to take on a completely different role — one seemingly at odds with her career so far. Tiffany Cabán, welcome to intercepted.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you for having me.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">My first question, just a very simple one: why on earth do you want to be a prosecutor?</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a question that I asked myself to start, as well. I think we&#8217;re moving in a place where it&#8217;s sort of the perfect storm of conditions, where as a country, we are really reckoning with our criminal justice system. Public defenders on the front lines have always known that our system is racist. It is classist. It is one that creates two systems of justice, one for the wealthy, and one for the poor. And right now, we are seeing an environment where district attorneys around the country are reimagining what it means to be a prosecutor and saying that instead of punishing for the sake of punishing, that we are going to strive to make sure that we are stabilizing communities. We&#8217;re de-carcerating. We&#8217;re centering community solutions. We are providing access to resources and support to keep people in their communities and just applying the law fairly across racial and class lines.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;ve adopted the term de-carceral prosecutor to describe yourself. Explain for people that may not know what you&#8217;re talking about what that means.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The word progressive prosecutor, I think has been overused to the point where it just has lost all of its meaning. And we need to have a true commitment to ending our system of mass incarceration through decarceration. You know, too often so-called progressive prosecutors come out with policies that sound good on paper, but I&#8217;m in court seeing that those policies have asterisks and our clients that are the exception to the rule before — namely our black and brown, our low income, and our immigrant communities — they continue to be the exception to the rule.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, you, of course, have gotten a very high profile endorsement that of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She, of course, beat a long-serving incumbent who was a very powerful figure in not just in Queens, but in the Democratic Party. And Joe Crowley, who AOC defeated, features in your race as well because he has been backing Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, who is your opponent. And you said the following:</span></p>\n<p><b>TC [campaign ad]: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s a career politician who hasn&#8217;t spent a single day in criminal court.</span></p>\n<p><b>Unknown voice: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not true.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, it&#8217;s true.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I want you to talk about Katz. But first, how the Democratic Party machine that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had to fight against, how they are approaching you and your candidacy in this race?</span></p>\n<p><b>TC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I, in so many ways, represent a clean break from the status quo. What I represent is bold, transformative change. What I represent is really centering the experiences of our community members, the folks that have been most directly impacted by our justice system. This about building a movement where we are empowering communities. And it&#8217;s not just the folks that have typically been in office, in power, making decisions that have continued to harm the same communities that continue to be oppressed and marginalized. So, for me, this is movement-building. This is about speaking truth to power. And then, this is about saying that the folks who are most directly impacted should actually be the ones that are in power.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have held strong on our positions from day one to the point where we&#8217;re really proud to say at this point, that not only are we, you know, shaping the conversation, controlling the conversation, but other candidates, including Melinda Katz are changing their policy positions to meet us where we&#8217;re at. So, my concerns are if our communities are calling for these changes in our justice system, who do you trust to implement them? You know, somebody who has always held these positions, or somebody who has decided just three, four months ago that these are the positions that they hold?</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What we&#8217;re trying to do is take a DA&#8217;s office that has thrown black and brown people in jail for small amounts of marijuana, for jumping turnstiles, but then does nothing when a landlord turns off your heat in the middle of the winter, when a predatory lender, you know, steals your home. And if we&#8217;re going to start holding those bad actors accountable, we have to be entirely independent of them.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You know, given your work as a public defender, I think it would be helpful if you explain to people what the cash bail system in this country and also in Queens where you are running for DA impacts the kinds of people that you end up defending in court.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Absolutely. I mean, as a public defender, I represent folks who can&#8217;t afford to defend themselves. They are people who find themselves on Rikers Island, proven guilty of nothing, but they can&#8217;t get off of the island because they can&#8217;t afford their bail. So, I am in support of ending cash bail entirely. It is wrong, because we can&#8217;t have two systems of justice, right? You can&#8217;t say that if you are accused of a low level nonviolent offense and whether you are poor or whether you are wealthy, you&#8217;re going to be presumed to be released and you get to fight your case from your community and return to court on your own. But if you&#8217;re charged with a violent felony, if you are poor, you stay in a cage on Rikers Island. And if you are wealthy, you get to buy your constitutional right to the presumption of innocence, and that&#8217;s just wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Where do you fall on the issue of what should happen with Rikers Island and the prison there?</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Rikers Island absolutely has to be closed, there is no way to make Rikers Island a humane place. You can&#8217;t do it. And if we are going to, again, commit to dismantling the system of mass incarceration and de-carcerating our city— And so, often I talk about the fact that we get stuck in this place of well, good people and bad people and we need to lock up the bad people. But this is just really about people and access to resources and stabilizing services and so many different situations.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t also support the building of massive new structures or jails because our prison industrial complex — it&#8217;s a money making business. And history shows that when you build jail cells, you fill them. And so again, if we&#8217;re going to have a real commitment to de-carcerating, if we are going to have a real commitment to changing behavior, reducing harm, and rehabilitating, we need to be expending more time, energy and resources into providing people access to things like health care, harm reduction services, job and education opportunities because in so many ways, stability equals public safety.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">On a very serious note, what do you think should be done with past abuses by prosecutors or the police?</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">We still have folks that have done a lot of harm to our communities still employed. We still have police officers that have engaged in egregious misconduct still employed and making arrests on our streets. We still have prosecutors engaging and in misconduct and unethical practices, and those are folks that should not remain in their positions. So yes, we&#8217;re going to look forward and make a lot of these changes. But we also need to look back and say one, we&#8217;re going to make it untenable for bad officers to stay employed by refusing to take their cases when we know they have a history of misconduct.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Can you talk about your position on decriminalizing sex work, but maybe begin by explaining the crisis impacting voluntary sex workers right now in Queens or in general in this country?</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">In so many ways sex work is survival work. It&#8217;s sort of twofold. This is an economic issue. It is a human rights issue. If we want to effectively combat trafficking, we need to fully decriminalize sex work. Here in Queens, we have the largest community of trans Latina sex workers in Jackson Heights. In Flushing, for example, we have a population of migrant workers working in our massage parlors. These are folks that have been systematically discriminated against in our communities. And so literally, this is how people are being able to put food on their table and take care of themselves and their families.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By criminalizing sex workers, we&#8217;re creating a space where we drive the behavior underground, and we create barriers to access to health care and law enforcement help when folks are victims or survivors of trafficking, of coercion, of assault or sexual assault for fear of criminalization when they go and get help. We&#8217;ve seen in other places that if you decriminalize just sex workers, and continue to prosecute their customers, one, you&#8217;re not fixing the problem in terms of the economic inequities, right? Because you&#8217;re cutting off the way that they&#8217;re supporting themselves, but two, you&#8217;re incentivizing the harassment by law enforcement. So, you have police officers, over policing, coercing and harassing sex workers to get information about their customers, and it&#8217;s resulting in a lot of harm to our sex work community.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, those are all the reasons why I support full decriminalization. You know, we have right here in Queens, a sex trafficking court that has been woefully ineffective at targeting true sex trafficking cases. And all it really has done has cycled again, already marginalized communities into our justice system and further destabilized their lives. And so, how long are we going to continue to do things that don&#8217;t work and continue to harm our communities rather than help them?</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">On the issue of the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and agents who abuse their power, you&#8217;ve suggested that you want to go after them and prosecute them. How would that — what would that look like given that we&#8217;re talking about federal forces here that yes, they&#8217;re operating in your borough in Queens, but just explain your approach to that and why you think that would even be possible.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Much in the way that we are going to hold police officers accountable, we&#8217;re not going to let people hide behind their badges, whether federal or state if they commit crimes against our community members. So, if somebody is assaulted, sexually assaulted, if somebody dies in their custody, and that occurs in Queens, we are going to hold them accountable. We need to create an environment where we are also showing our immigrant communities that we are there to protect them, and that we are not going to be cooperating with ICE in any manner.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I always say, I never cease to be amazed by the new and creative and inventive ways that our district attorney&#8217;s offices have managed to continue to over-criminalize and over-prosecute our black and brown communities. And if we take that kind of commitment and creativity to helping keep our immigrant community safe here in Queens and making it so that it is not a place where ICE can come in and really ravage our communities, and we should be doing absolutely everything we can within the limits of the law to do that.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a report, I&#8217;m sure you recall this back in 2015 by the San Francisco-based Women Donors Network and it was published by the New York Times and it examined the racial disparity of prosecutors in this country. And they found that prosecutors were 95 percent white in total, 79 percent men, and only one percent of local or federal district attorneys are women of color, four percent are men of color. How are you going to confront the entrenched power and reality of how these prosecutorial systems are run and who runs them?</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not enough to say that I am going to go out and hire a diverse cross section of our communities to work in the office. I have always said that there is a reason why as a queer Latina from a low-income community that I became a public defender and not a prosecutor because I didn&#8217;t feel like I could go into a DA&#8217;s office and do anything other than harm my community rather than help the communities that I came from. So, in changing culture and changing those metrics of success and creating a system where we are prioritizing more equitable justice, then I think that&#8217;s the best way to naturally start to diversify our offices and that&#8217;s certainly step one.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Share with people a little bit about your family background and your upbringing.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Public defense work is trauma work, just like being a teacher is trauma work, being a doctor in so many ways, social worker — it&#8217;s trauma work. and oftentimes what brings you to trauma work is your own trauma. And the reason why I became a public defender and now, the reason why I want to be the district attorney is rooted in my family history. My grandfather was somebody who was incredibly physically abusive. He was an alcoholic and abusive to the point where my grandmother finally left him and my mom dropped out of high school to help take care of the family. And, you know, years later after my brother was born, after I was born, my mom let my grandfather back into our lives. He was dying. And she wanted him to know his grandchildren, his grandchildren to know him. And the man that I got to know was just absolutely incredible. Like I loved him so much. I hung on his every word. He told me these just wildly fantastical stories.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And long after he passed, I mean, after, when I was an adult, reflecting on this really abusive husband and father and this really incredible grandfather, and recognizing that they were both so equally true. And that ours was a system, our criminal justice system was one that he could have been cycling in and out of and it was also one that didn&#8217;t account for the fact that he was also a poor kid from Puerto Rico, who served our country in the Korean War, earned a Purple Heart, came home with PTSD, self medicated with alcohol and where were our systems in place to support him so that he could support his family, right? Like those are failures of our system. And then recognizing that it&#8217;s not just about his experiences and his own individual trauma, but then how that impacts generationally, how that impacts me and the way that I interact with the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, often when I&#8217;m doing my work as a public defender, I think about the fact that there is very little that separates me from my clients, but for access to privileges and opportunities that they didn&#8217;t have, that my neighbors didn&#8217;t have, some of my family members didn&#8217;t have. And often, the one thing that I point to is the fact that my dad got a union job, which meant that I had a roof over my head. I had access to health care, education opportunities, and probably most important for me as an adult access to therapy services.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That goes back to this idea I talked about before that this is not about good people and bad people. This is just about people, and whether we give them access to the things that they need to be healthier, more whole human beings. We need to start looking at every single case from that trauma informed perspective and try to heal first before continuing to do harm because, you know, so much of our system is not corrective. It&#8217;s not rehabilitative, but we really do have this incredible opportunity to start changing that.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Tiffany Cabán, thank you very much for the work that you&#8217;re doing and we wish you luck in your race.</span></p>\n<p><b>TC: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Tiffany Cabán is running for District Attorney of Queens, New York.

In this race, the candidates are all calling for reform, paying lip service to a range of concerns about the injustices within the criminal justice system. But the records of several of the candidates in this race indicate a cozy relationship to law enforcement. One candidate in that race is very different from the rest. I&#8217;m talking about the current Deputy Public Defender of San Francisco, Chesa Boudin.</span></p>\n<p><b>Chesa Boudin [campaign ad]: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I learned that our criminal justice system is broken. It’s a system of mass incarceration plagued by racial disparities. Instead of equal justice, we have money bail. Instead of meaningful treatment, we use solitary confinement. Instead of funding schools, we build prisons.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesa Boudin learned those lessons at an early age. His parents were members of the Weather Underground, a militant anti-imperialist anti-war organization that was active in the 1960s and 70s.</span></p>\n<p><b>Newscaster: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">KPFK received a call from a woman identifying herself as a member of the Weather Underground.</span></p>\n<p><b>Woman&#8217;s voice: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Hello, I&#8217;m going to read a declaration of a state of war. This is the first communication from the Weatherman Underground.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesa Boudin’s parents Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert were getaway drivers in a botched armed robbery in 1981 that tragically took the lives of three men. Boudin’s parents didn’t actually kill anyone but they were charged under New York’s felony murder rule. His father remains incarcerated, serving a 75 years to life sentence. His mom served 22 years before being paroled in 2003. Chesa Boudin was adopted by fellow Weather Underground activists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn and he grew up in Chicago.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a story that Boudin does not shy away from. Rather, it&#8217;s one that has taught him some hard lessons and set him on a path to becoming a public defender. He joins me now to talk about just how he plans on doing this.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesa Boudin welcome to Intercepted.</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks so much, Jeremy, great to be here.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This experience that you had beginning at just 14 months old, and then having to go and visit your parents and you&#8217;ve talked about your mother parenting you from prison. And I&#8217;m curious, given your life experience, why you would have decided to become a prosecutor, the very kind of people that put your parents away? Your dad, probably for his entire life and your mom for the majority of her young adult life.</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">My whole life has been shaped by our criminal justice system. I saw firsthand the phrase that we hear used so often, mass incarceration, I saw firsthand what that meant. You know, growing up, my earliest memories are the lines of mostly black and brown women and children waiting to get searched so they could see or touch their father, their brother, their son behind bars. You know, my memories are of the invisible ink that guards would stamp on my hand, which was a passport back to freedom at the end of the prison visit as my parents were being strip-searched and going back to the cages that they called home.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, that experience is part of what led me to want to become a public defender. And this is the moment in San Francisco and across the country when there&#8217;s a political space to think outside the box about how we can redefine and reimagine the role of prosecutors to be something more than simply sending young black and brown men to prison.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Just go through your top issues on why you&#8217;re running and how you think you could change the nature of the so-called criminal justice system in San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Big picture, it is all about public safety. But I think for far too long public safety has been narrowly defined to basically mean wealthy people&#8217;s property rights. And I think public safety actually is a much broader concept than that. And I think the criminal justice system has really broad implications for public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, when we choose to send someone to jail or prison for a nonviolent offense, we know that there is a significant risk of them committing suicide while incarcerated. We know there&#8217;s a significant risk of them being sexually or physically assaulted while incarcerated. We know that their incarceration will actually make it more likely that when released, they engage in some other criminal conduct. All of that is public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And by the same token, we know that the majority of people who go to prison our parents in this country. And when their children are left behind the way that I was, it actually increases the chances that their children will end up committing crime creating more victims.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I was talking yesterday in preparation for our conversation with a longtime activist around immigration and police brutality issues and has done extensive work with the Black Alliance for Just Immigration. He basically — I said I was going to be talking to you and that I was going to be talking to Tiffany Cabán. And he said, &#8220;You know that that&#8217;s great that these guys are taking on cash bail, that they say they want police accountability, but what are they going to do about all the past crimes that have been committed by prosecutors against black and brown and immigrant communities? What is their position on holding people accountable for the crimes that have been committed systematically for decades against these communities that you&#8217;re describing?&#8221; What&#8217;s your stance on holding those accountable who came before you or actions that come before you if you win, take the position as district attorney?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, we have a few plans on that. One is, I&#8217;ve already announced that I intend to create a wrongful conviction unit in the district attorney&#8217;s office. That will be a fully staffed unit that takes its marching orders from an outside advisory board of experts who will review past convictions, whether the person is still incarcerated or has already served their time and consider reopening and potentially reversing convictions that as you say, were a result of falsified evidence or, you know, racially motivated investigations, etcetera. Another thing is that there is a new law in California that allows prosecutors even in cases where the conviction was accurate or where the defendant in fact did commit the crime they were convicted of, but that allows us to reopen cases for purposes of re-sentencing. It&#8217;s a law that recognizes the extreme, draconian punishments that have been meted out for far too long and allows us to show some mercy and to ratchet down some old sentences.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">How would you approach working with the police while simultaneously going after some of the sacred cows of that system and how it has operated for basically forever?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The relationship between the District Attorney&#8217;s office and the police department is a critical one. We have to work together. But we also have to be independent. And we also have to hold each other accountable and hold each other to high standard. Historically, police in San Francisco and so much of the country have been allowed to commit crimes, including murder with impunity, that has to stop. I actually don&#8217;t believe that in San Francisco, the Police Officers Association represents the views of the majority of officers. I think it represents the views of a small fringe extremist group of officers. We have a significant number of police officers in San Francisco who are honest, hard-working, who wake up every morning and put on their uniform and star with the intention of going out and serving and protect[ing] their communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is imperative that the next district attorney liberate and empower those officers, and not allow the small minority who rob, steal, lie under oath, and even execute unarmed civilians to control the politics and the image of the department. We have to rebuild the trust between our communities and law enforcement. And that starts by letting every single person in San Francisco, including members of our police department know that police also must follow the law.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You know, inequality in San Francisco is stark as it is in New York City where I&#8217;m speaking to you from and that city also has seen a sharp rise in homelessness. In your view, what role would you as district attorney play in combating systemic inequality in San Francisco?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Many of the problems that have been dumped on the criminal justice system over the last several decades are not, primarily criminal justice problems. They&#8217;re public health crises, mental health crises, drug addiction, wealth inequality, as you say, housing. To be sure, in San Francisco a very high percentage of the crime that&#8217;s committed is motivated by mental illness, drug addiction and poverty. Seventy-five percent of the people booked into county jail suffer from extreme mental illness, drug addiction or both. And in the neighborhood of a third of people in county jail are homeless or marginally housed.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is imperative that we start looking at the root causes of crime and holding people who commit crime accountable in ways that gets at those root causes. So, if someone commits a crime because of their mental illness, we need to ensure that their arrest results in mental health treatment. If someone commits a crime because of their drug addiction, we need to ensure that their arrest results and drug treatment and that needs to be true regardless of whether criminal charges are filed, or conviction is secured. It&#8217;s the only way that we&#8217;re going to break the cycle of recidivism. It&#8217;s the only way that we&#8217;re going to meaningfully make our community safer, and do so in a way that&#8217;s both cost effective and humane.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Are there any classes of crimes that currently can result in people being sent to jail that you would refuse to prosecute as district attorney?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I would not enforce laws that criminalize homelessness. We have people in San Francisco who don&#8217;t have the ability to pay for rent, who live in tents, or who camp out in various parts of the city. And we still see some of those people brought to court on criminal charges for things like illegal camping or public nuisance. I would never file those criminal charges. I believe we should solve the homelessness crisis not punish people for their poverty.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, with simple possession of drugs. You know, we still have people prosecuted for carrying a glass pipe, for example, or for carrying trace amounts of illegal drugs. I think it&#8217;s a terrible use of law enforcement resources. I think it is an intervention that actually results in more crime and more instability in members of our community who are already marginalized and at risk.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">San Francisco is aiming to close its juvenile hall by 2021 and that would make it understand the first city to shut down its juvenile detention center. And that move came as youth crime rates were dropping, and the cost of maintaining that facility were growing.</span></p>\n<p><b>KRON 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The 150-bed facility is housing just about 30 to 40 young people at one time, meaning the city of spending nearly $300,000 per child.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s the significance first of all of San Francisco moving to close juvenile hall, and then more broadly, what will be your approach to juvenile justice or when minors are the subject of criminal inquiries or prosecution?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s really exciting, Jeremy. You know, San Francisco is well positioned to lead the rest of the country on a wide range of criminal justice reforms. That&#8217;s part of why I&#8217;m running for district attorney. To have a progressive majority on our board of supervisors that is committed to some of the same goals will really make possible things that wouldn&#8217;t have been even imaginable a few years ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Closing juvenile hall is a is a primary commitment of my campaign. I want to treat kids like kids. There&#8217;s no reason why we should put kids in cages. We should invest in education, not incarceration. And this resolution lays the groundwork for that. But to be successful, the Board of Supervisors will need a partner in the district attorney, they will need someone who is committed to the same fundamental goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that we can treat kids like kids. I know that we can do far more to keep our community safe, and to recognize the fundamental humanity and promise that every single child in this city has with the $300,000 a year we are currently spending to incarcerate kids. If we would invest even a fraction of that money in families, in schools, in communities, we could do more to support our kids and prevent recidivism than the current approach to caging kids would ever accomplish.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;ve talked about in your own biography, in your own story, notions of restorative justice. And you know, you&#8217;ve spoken quite openly about the process by which you were able to forgive your parents and, you know, and accept this unorthodox family that you grew up with where you essentially had four parents — two of whom were your adopted parents that were raising you in the outside world and two of whom were your biological parents that were incarcerated, and your dad, of course, continues to be incarcerated. How does that, the lessons you learned about restorative justice apply to your view of enforcing the law in San Francisco and how would you implement alternative structures of achieving justice that don&#8217;t involve handcuffs in prison and long sentences?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Every victim of every crime in San Francisco should have the right to engage in a restorative justice process if they choose to do so. And when I&#8217;m district attorney, they will. What that means depends on the victim, depends on the person who caused harm, and depends on the specific charges. But at core, it means that we should be seeking to heal the harm that was caused, not simply to punish the perpetrator. All too often in today&#8217;s criminal justice system, victims are used to secure lengthy draconian punishment, but have nothing to show for their suffering and don&#8217;t experience any healing or tangible benefit from the billions of dollars that we invest in punishing people.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know from my parents experience that far more significant to my mom&#8217;s change and growth than the 22 years she spent in prison was a relationship she built while in prison with one of the victims of her crime. That kind of experience was more transformative for my mother, and more healing for the victim than any number of years of incarceration would be. In San Francisco, whether it&#8217;s a broken car window, or whether it&#8217;s something far more serious, we should give victims the right to participate in the process, to have a voice and to be heard, and we should respond to their needs. Restorative justice is much more effective at holding people who cause harm accountable than prisons.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I assume critics would come back and say, well, that sounds like you&#8217;re recommending that we all become social workers and that you&#8217;re going to be instead of the district attorney, kind of the lead social worker, or in some cases therapist and that this is untenable, and it&#8217;s too vague, and it requires an oversimplification of categories of crime to engage in this process, and that&#8217;s why we have to have laws and consequences if laws are broken. How would you respond to that?</span></p>\n<p><b>CB: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">We should have laws and we should have consequences when laws are broken. But those consequences should focus on ensuring that the person who broke the law doesn&#8217;t do it again. And right now we have the most expensive and least effective system that you could possibly imagine or create when it comes to that core public safety function. We have recidivism rates in state prison in California that are above two-thirds. We have a recidivism rate in San Francisco County Jail of above 100 percent. And for the 10 percent of the California state budget that we spend on our prison system, we can do better, and we can do better in a way that specifically recognizes the real needs that victims have and that are being unmet today.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, on that note, we will leave it there.

Horrific video footage of the raid shows forces opening fire and killing civilians. Doctors in Sudan</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/sudan-troops-protesters-attack-sit-in-rape-khartoum-doctors-report?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"><span style="font-weight: 400"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> more than 70 rapes occured, more than 100 people were killed, and hundreds more were injured in this raid.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The protest movement has been building since December with widespread demands for civilian rule. In April, the military ousted long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir. But now the interim military government has turned on the protesters.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Filmmaker and activist Hajooj Kuka brings us his account of what has transpired in recent days.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Group of people singing at sit-in.]</span></p>\n<p><b>Hajooj Kuka: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">On a normal day of the sit-in, we would have 30,000 people, if nothing’s happening. Then in the morning, there&#8217;ll be less people. I would stay in the sit-in. So for a whole month, I rarely left the sit-in. It became this whole mini community that had people from all over Sudan, and we&#8217;re talking a lot about the future was going to happen, how do we organize beyond this.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">June 3, was when the transitional military council decided they&#8217;re gonna dismantle the sit-in. There was about 10,000 of us, and throughout the night, we&#8217;re there and then the sun started coming out. It was around 5:00 a.m. And then the attack started. Thousands of Rapid Response Force people with sticks dashing in and just beating everybody else up. Then they started the bullets. Once they started, they just continued and you just couldn&#8217;t hear anything except for continuous rounds of automatic firing.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then at that point, we noticed that Rapid Response Force had entered the sit-in and we looked through the window and we saw them coming in numbers. We tried to go outside, but there was this sniper that was on the building next to us and apparently, he was within the sit-in. He didn&#8217;t come with them. And he was shooting so we couldn&#8217;t move out. So, we ran into another office, and we hid and we can hear the firing. And we can hear people being beaten up. And we stayed quiet for a while. And then they started knocking on our door.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we all looked at each other, and we decided we&#8217;re going to leave, but we have to leave without anything. So we opened the door and we went outside and there was like a huge number of them all with sticks. And some had guns with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have long dreads and somebody rushed, took out his knife and decided that now I&#8217;m going to cut the dread and he started like trying to cut the dread. And then somebody from the back with this huge thick stick just hit me on the head. And I started bleeding. And I fell on the ground and then my blood was just all over me. And then at that point somebody else was like if he&#8217;s on the ground, let&#8217;s just finish him up and somebody else was saying no, we shouldn&#8217;t. And then I got up and they were like walk. I was hit on the top of my head. So, the blood was from the top of my head coming down my face into my eye and the back into my neck.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, who attacked us? They&#8217;re this group called the Rapid Response Force and the Rapid Response Force is led by Hemeti, who became notorious during the 2003, 2005 genocide in Darfur. He was a young janjaweed at the time and janjaweed is the term we gave to the people who are killing folks in Darfur and they were like burning, looting, raping, killing, beating the villagers in Darfur and they were armed by Omar al-Bashir at the time to fight the rebels but they did very little fighting of the rebels and mainly fought civilians and killed and raped. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, this is exactly what they did. If you consider the sit-in as a small village, they actually burned the tents in the sit-in. They raped. They looted. They didn&#8217;t just rape the women. They also raped some men too, and kids. They used machetes to just cut folks. They killed people by beating them. They killed others by shooting them. They threw people into the Nile. Some of them we don&#8217;t know if they were dead already, but there is more than 40 bodies that were retrieved from the Nile.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So this is janjaweed</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">This is who attacked us. And the main thing about Hemeti is he is the vice of the Transitional Military Council. So he&#8217;s the vice president of Sudan at the moment. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially, during the protest, a new slogan came about and it&#8217;s called Tuss-goot Bass which let it fall. It became the answer to everything. So anytime somebody wants to argue with you about government, about give it a chance, let&#8217;s try reform. Let&#8217;s try this, you just say Tuss-goot Bass, and this empowered everybody and the ask became very simple. The only way this is going to go forward is for Tuss-goot Bass.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Protesters chanting continues.]</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Hajooj Kuka is the director of Beats of the Antonov, a documentary about war and music in the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains regions of Sudan.

Gallab is Sudanese American and, like many in the diaspora, has been closely following the tick tock of the popular uprising in Sudan via Twitter, WhatsApp and other social media platforms.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Omar al-Bashir’s legacy and the ongoing struggle for an end to military rule in Sudan has particular significance for Gallab’s family. They sought political asylum in the United States following the coup that brought Bashir to power in 1989.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This story of displacement is a common one for Sudanese people globally as their country has witnessed multiple civil wars, genocide and catastrophic famines in just the past three decades.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gallab’s new album is called “Depayse” — a French word that means “removed from one’s habitual surroundings.” Here is Ahmed Gallab of Sinkane.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[“Everyone” by Sinkane plays]</span></p>\n<p><b>Ahmed Gallab: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">My name is Ahmed Gallab. Ahmed Gallab, if you can pronounce it. I am a Sudanese American musician based in Brooklyn, New York from Khartoum, Sudan. I&#8217;m a brother. I&#8217;m a friend. I&#8217;m really anything you want me to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Protestors chanting.]</span></p>\n<p><b>AG: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">So, in 1989, there was a general election in Sudan. It was four years after Nimeiry was ousted, the former dictator and Sudan had a very short stint of democracy. My dad was a diplomat for the Sudanese government. In &#8217;89, there was a general election and that year, my family was also living in Boston. My dad was studying at Boston University. The idea was we were going to be with him for the year and then we were going to go back. The election happened and Omar al-Bashir, who was running with the National Islamic Front at the time lost but overthrew the government of Sudan and established a coup that succeeded. My father&#8217;s friends started disappearing. A lot of people went to jail that were affiliated with the government. People died, and we applied for asylum in the United States, and stayed.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Omar al-Bashir overthrew the government in 1989, I was a really young person. I was five years old. So, I didn&#8217;t know that it was dangerous in Sudan at the time. I didn&#8217;t know what happened politically. I just did what you do when you&#8217;re five years old, just follow your parents lead. It wasn&#8217;t until maybe I was 11 or 12 years old that I realized, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not from America. My family&#8217;s Sudanese and we don&#8217;t live where we&#8217;re from.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was 11 and 12, I was living in Provo, Utah, kind of the weirdest place for a person like me to be living. But I remember around that time, my family went back to Sudan just for a summer, you know, and I kind of like fit right back in. You know, I hadn&#8217;t spoken Arabic in four or five years because I lived in the United States. And I came back and I saw my cousins again and it was like, right where we left off. And then I went back to Sudan in high school, and I realized I wasn&#8217;t Sudanese. Everything started changing. All my cousins started growing up. And I realized how different I was from all my cousins and all the people in Sudan and that&#8217;s when this like, crazy identity thing started happening with me.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[“Stranger”  by Sinkane plays.]</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Music was definitely a part of our household. Waking up every weekend to, you know, Sudanese tapes, distorted, blaring out of our sound system at home.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[“Argos Farfish” by Sharhabeel Ahmed plays.]</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mohammed Wardi, Sharhabil, Kamal Tarbas, Al Balabil, Mohammed El-Amin&#8230;there&#8217;s so many. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside of the just the Sudanese stuff and the African music, there was a lot of like Phil Collins and Abba and Michael Jackson and Miles Davis and everything was very much rooted around drums.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You know, it sounded very beat driven and I was really attached and connected to the drums. So, I started creating makeshift drum kits in my house. I&#8217;d take like all the cookie jars that my parents had like, the tin cookie jars and create a drum kit. Around the sixth grade, my friends wanted to start a band and they needed a drummer. And so, I made every effort that I could to my parents to figure out a way to bring me a drum kit home, you know, and they brought me a drum kit home and I decided that that&#8217;s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[“How We Be”  by Sinkane plays.]</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started singing in 2006. I realized at the time that I had never really made music that really truly represented me. And what that turned into was like a study of my identity in a very like, deep way.</span></p>\n<p><b>DJT: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Remember this. So listen, Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country&#8217;s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.</span></p>\n<p><b>AG: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The Muslim ban and Trump being elected, you know, at the time, it was like, all of the police shootings were happening. And it felt like tensions were so high. And I just wanted to write music that made me feel good because I&#8217;d walk out of my rehearsal space and just hear about another person dying in the hands of a cop. And as I was playing the songs and connecting with people at Sinkane shows and finding more people like me at my shows, it really started to make me think about my place as a musician in the world and like to really talk about some important things, you know, in my way.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[“Everybody”  by Sinkane plays.]</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized a lot of people connected with Sinkane because it made them feel safe. And they were inspired that a person that looked like them and spoke their language and came from where they came from, was out there doing something, just by being a Sudanese American making music, that&#8217;s a political statement unto itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the album is &#8220;Depayse,&#8221; which is a French word that means to be removed from one&#8217;s habitual surroundings. It&#8217;s a positive thing. And I thought that was just such a beautiful way to describe my experience. &#8220;Depayse,&#8221; the song came about out of a dream that I had. I woke up and in my dream I was walking around Sudan, you know, in Omdurman, really where my family&#8217;s from. It was at night time and you know, I was hearing this like melody. And I was kind of following the melody and I saw this person in front of my family&#8217;s house, sitting cross-legged playing guitar. In my dream, I&#8217;m walking a bit more and I get up close and it was my dad. I woke up, frantically woke up, and went straight to my phone and recorded what I had heard, you know, like in a haze and didn&#8217;t quite record the right, the right words, but I recorded it.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ahmed Gallab singing followed by “Depayse” by Sinkane.]</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That kind of informed the entire song.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a kid going back to Sudan, it was almost like everyone was walking on eggshells. You know, you couldn&#8217;t say anything bad about the government. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current events happening in Sudan that led to Omar al-Bashir being overthrown, the price of bread became more expensive than an average person&#8217;s living wage. Gas shortages started happening. And inflation became so high that the money stopped having any real value. Omar al-Bashir had been in power for 30 years, almost 31 years at that point, you know, one of the longest dictatorships in the history of Africa. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People stopped having anything to lose. And they started responding to the famine, to the inflation, to everything that was going on. You know, it was just dismal. It was crazy. It was a domino effect. Once one person started doing something about it, 20 people and then it became 100 and then it became 1,000, then it became the whole city. And as I saw that, from the outside, I became so inspired by it and not only me, but other Sudanese people all outside of Sudan became very inspired. And we thought to ourselves individually, what can we all do to support our people in Sudan, you know? </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re the ones sacrificing themselves. They&#8217;re the ones really fighting for all of us. And now what you&#8217;re seeing is a country still, almost seven months later, people camped up in the military complex of Sudan, saying we&#8217;re not going to leave. And we&#8217;re not going to get out of here until you transition power to a civilian government and you give us what we want. That just really showcases the resilience and the strength and the power of the people in Sudan, in the community that exists of all people in Sudan, all Sudanese people all over the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sudan is a country made up of difference. There&#8217;s a lot of different cultures, a lot of different indigenous groups, a lot of different languages, a lot of different religions. And because of that, it&#8217;s a country rich in knowledge, you know, rich in like spirit, in generosity, in beauty, you know, in everything. You are challenged daily to understand other people and the more that you understand other people, the smarter you are, the better of a person that you are, the more harmony exists in your life.</span></p>\n<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">That was Ahmed Gallab of Sinkane.

      'content:encoded': '<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><u>In preparation for</u> Wednesday’s hearing on Medicare for All before the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the panel’s chair met privately with Democrats to lay out how he wants it to unfold. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been in office since 1989, told the Democrats on the panel that he didn’t want the phrase “Medicare for All” to be used. Instead, he said, the hearing should focus on all the different ways to achieve “universal health care” or “universal health coverage,” which he said was a better term to deploy. Medicare for All, he argued, was wrong on policy and is a political loser, sources present for the meeting, held last Wednesday, told The Intercept. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neal confirmed that he recommended a shift in emphasis. Asked whether he encouraged members in private to focus tomorrow’s hearing more on “universal health care” than Medicare for All, Neal said the conversation would be more about “universal health care and access,” pointing to his continued support for the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think what we’re talking about, we’re talking about universal health care and access,” he told The Intercept. “That’s the emphasis. So we have not ruled anything out or ruled anything in. And we think that continuing to gathering information — I mean, I helped to write the Affordable Care Act, I’m naturally in favor of expanding it, and, you know, 100% of the children in Massachusetts are covered, 97% of the adults. We’ve had a good experience with it.”</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>Moving to the bigger stage of Ways and Means, which has jurisdiction over taxation and government revenue, represents a new high-water mark for Medicare for All.</blockquote>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hearing will be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday in the Longworth House Office Building and </span><a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/pathways-universal-health-coverage"><span style="font-weight: 400">will include five witnesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, all of whom are, at a minimum, sympathetic to Medicare for All. That the committee is holding a hearing at all on Medicare for All is a win for the Congressional Progressive Caucus and its co-chair, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and signals momentum for the legislation. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/30/medicare-for-all-rules-committee-hearing/">Rules Committee hearing </a>in April </span><span style="font-weight: 400">marked the first of its kind in history for the push for single-payer, and moving to the bigger stage of Ways and Means, which has jurisdiction over taxation and government revenue, represents a new high-water mark for Medicare for All. Holding hearings is the start of creating the legislative history of a bill and often signals — as it does in this case — that public support for a measure has risen to a significant enough level that Congress is willing to spend its limited attention on the issue. </span></p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'>\n<a href="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_19102540918035-jayapal-pocan-1560288366.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254510" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_19102540918035-jayapal-pocan-1560288366-1024x683.jpg" alt="AP_19102540918035-jayapal-pocan-1560288366" /></a></p>\n<p class="caption">Reps. Pramila Jayapal, left, and Mark Pocan talk with the media at the House Democrats&#8217; 2019 Issues Conference in Leesburg, Va., on April 11, 2019.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source\' style=\'\'>Photo: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP</p></div>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jayapal, a lead sponsor of the House Medicare for All bill, and her co-chair Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., won a commitment for a Ways and Means hearing from Nancy Pelosi as the party leader was working to round up votes in her bid for House speaker. But converting that pledge into a hearing required the assent of the committee’s chair, Neal. When Neal came to speak to the CPC on April 30, Jayapal pressed him in person, and he committed there to the hearing. The result is Wednesday’s hearing, but its title, “Pathways to Universal Health Coverage,” hints at the internal tension.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of that tension comes from Democrats who are pushing alternatives to Medicare for All, such as Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., the lead sponsor of a measure to allow people </span><span style="font-weight: 400">over the age of 50</span><a href="https://larson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-larson-courtney-higgins-welch-introduce-medicare-buy-and-health"><span style="font-weight: 400"> to buy into Medicare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. After Neal consented to the Medicare for All hearing at Jayapal’s request, Higgins pressured him for his own hearing on the Medicare buy-in proposal. (Higgins had declared publicly he would not support Pelosi for speaker in 2018 but relented when she </span><a href="https://buffalonews.com/2018/11/21/higgins-in-a-reversal-will-back-pelosi/"><span style="font-weight: 400">publicly agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to make the Medicare buy-in legislation a priority and recognized him as the lead sponsor of it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.) Instead of doing multiple hearings, Neal told Higgins to include his proposal in the Medicare for All hearing. Neal and one of his staffers both confirmed to The Intercept that the measure was added to tomorrow’s hearing at Higgins&#8217;s request. “As a part of the agreement with the speaker, we were sort of abiding by that agreement,” the staffer accompanying Neal on Capitol Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Higgins said Neal including the buy-in measure in tomorrow’s hearing was “a good acknowledgement of the speaker following through on her commitment to make a good faith effort to get Medicare at 50 on the agenda.” He said it was “fair” to say that Neal had been encouraging people to frame tomorrow’s discussion around pathways to universal health coverage rather than focusing on Medicare for All. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we do nothing to try to get a Medicare for All — first of all, there’s not consensus on what &#8216;Medicare for All&#8217; means,” he said. “Is that Medicare for everybody that wants it? Or is that Medicare for everybody, and it’s compulsory?” Higgins warned against “obliterating” private insurance, which he said lost the party support with the passing of the Affordable Care Act. Higgins supported the ACA at the time but said that while it was “deeply flawed in many, many ways,” its biggest flaw was “that it didn’t have a public option, because you need that countervailing force to private insurance. And I think that if we could accomplish that this year, that would be a major accomplishment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But getting rid of private insurance all together would be a mistake, Higgins said. “Do we really wanna create that schism going into 2020 for ourselves but also for the presidential election? The thing that we should be looking at — and we can do this all at the same time — is Medicare at 50 and concurrently working toward a more ambitious Medicare plan for those who want it. I mean, let’s be practical about this stuff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><u>Neal is widely</u> known to be skeptical of Medicare for All, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and insurance companies and drug makers are among</span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00000153"><span style="font-weight: 400"> his biggest financial backers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. He fended off a progressive primary challenge in 2018 but is likely to face a renewed one in 2020. He was a close ally of former caucus chair Joe Crowley, and privately among his colleagues is hostile to the new progressive energy — and support for single-payer — that swept into the House in 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking last week at a workforce development event at Springfield Technical Community College in Massachusetts, Neal said the two people he turned to most for economic advice were Bob Rubin and Jack Lew, both of whom are former secretaries of the Treasury, according to a source who was at the event. Rubin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and a chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, argued in a May </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/opinion/health-care-social-services.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHealth%20Insurance%20and%20Managed%20Care"><span style="font-weight: 400">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the New York Times that the secret to cutting health care costs is to spend more on social programs like “food stamps, free school lunches and public housing.”</span></p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neal actively opposed efforts by the CPC to place progressive members onto the Ways and Means Committee, people involved in that fight told The Intercept. Other chairs of top committees, including Frank Pallone at Energy and Commerce and Maxine Waters at Financial Services, did not object to progressives joining their panel, which has created an ideological imbalance across the committees. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neal did allow some members of the CPC to join, but generally he only accepted those who are also members or allies of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, such as Reps. Jimmy Panetta, Steven Horsford, and Brendan Boyle. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., was added to the committee and subsequently joined the CPC. Neal also welcomed Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., one of the most conservative Democrats in the caucus, onto the panel, as well as Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., who, like Murphy, is in the right-wing Blue Dog Coalition. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., meanwhile, </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/12/04/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-house-ways-and-means-committee/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sought a spot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the Ways and Means committee</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and was turned away, landing instead on Financial Services and Oversight and Reform.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>&#8220;I am 100% focused on the fact that this is a historic hearing in a major committee of record — something that has never happened before.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>Jayapal, who does not sit on Ways and Means and was not at the meeting with Neal, said that she is confident the hearing will nevertheless be a boost to the effort. “I wasn&#8217;t in the room, but I would just say it is impossible to have a hearing on Medicare for All without saying those words,” she said. “I am confident that our Medicare for All supporters on the committee will talk about the policy and the bill completely. And I am 100% focused on the fact that this is a historic hearing in a major committee of record — something that has never happened before. We appreciate the chairman holding this Medicare for All hearing.”</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One member of the panel who heard Neal’s remarks but declined to be named said that Neal’s message was less about trashing Medicare for All and more about making sure to highlight alternative paths to universal health care. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., another Democrat on the committee, said he wasn’t at the private meeting but that members have been encouraged to look at all available options. “We talk a little bit about everything, but I don’t think we’ve arrived at any point in terms of it,” he told The Intercept. Asked if Neal was pushing members away from Medicare for All, Davis said, “I’m not sure I’d say he was necessarily the lead on the thinking around that, but certainly in our health meetings we’ve discussed everything.”</span></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/11/medicare-for-all-ways-means-committee/">Ways and Means Committee Chair Doesn&#8217;t Want Medicare for All Hearing to Mention &#8220;Medicare for All&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Former Brazilian President</u> Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva should be released from prison and his conviction should be annulled, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, on Tuesday. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., meanwhile, is calling on the Trump administration to investigate the case that imprisoned the former president on corruption charges, following <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/secret-brazil-archive/">The Intercept&#8217;s exposé</a> that showed Judge Sérgio Moro plotted with prosecutors to convict Lula and prevent the Workers’ Party from returning to power.</p>\n<p>“This reporting confirms what we knew all along — that Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail,” Khanna told The Intercept in an emailed statement. “While [it&#8217;s] not for America to make a factual judgement on Lula’s innocence, this reporting shows Moro was not impartial and coordinated with the prosecutors. This violates all judicial norms and ethics. I hope the Trump administration supports a full investigation into this matter given Lula is still in jail and Moro is Bolsonaro’s justice minister.”</p>\n<p>Sanders said that the exposures should free Lula. &#8220;Today, it is clearer than ever that Lula da Silva was imprisoned in a politicized prosecution that denied him a fair trial and due process. During his presidency, Lula oversaw huge reductions in poverty and remains Brazil&#8217;s most popular politician. I stand with political and social leaders across the globe who are calling on Brazil&#8217;s judiciary to release Lula and annul his conviction,&#8221; Sanders said in a statement provided to The Intercept.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump has embraced Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s right-wing president who, like Trump, has a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/28/jair-bolsonaro-elected-president-brazil/">history</a> of making bigoted, homophobic, and misogynistic statements and even paid a visit to the White House in March.</p>\n<p>“They say he’s the Donald Trump of South America,” Trump<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election-results-trump-2018-10"> said </a>during a speech this past January. &#8220;Do you believe that? And he’s happy with that. If he wasn’t, I wouldn’t like the country so much. But I like him.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil published excerpts from a massive trove of secret documents, including<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/"> private admissions of doubt from prosecutors </a>about whether there was sufficient evidence to prove Lula’s guilt. The sweeping corruption probe, known as Operation Car Wash, stretches back five years and has resulted in hundreds of people being charged with hundreds of crimes.</p>\n<p>Lula, who was elected president in 2002 and 2006, was indicted under the probe and found guilty in 2017 of corruption and money laundering, charges that were connected to accepting bribes from construction firms. He was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Lula’s imprisonment forced him out of the 2018 presidential race, which he was widely expected to win; this paved the way for Bolsonaro, who then appointed Moro as justice minister. According to the archive, the prosecution also worked on strategies to prevent a prison interview with Lula during the election out of fear it could help the Workers’ Party.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>“That the same judge who found Lula guilty was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-sergio-moro-brazil-justice-ministry-anti-corruption">rewarded by Lula’s victorious opponent</a> made even longtime supporters of the Car Wash corruption probe uncomfortable, due to the obvious perception (real or not) of a quid pro quo, and by the transformation of Moro, who long insisted he was apolitical, into a political official working for the most far-right president ever elected in the history of Brazil’s democracy,” our report<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/"> said</a>. “Those concerns heightened when Bolsonaro <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2019/05/bolsonaro-says-he-will-nominate-sergio-moro-to-the-supreme-court.shtml">recently admitted</a> that he had also promised to appoint Moro to a lifelong seat on the Supreme Court as soon as there was a vacancy.”</p>\n<p>In light of The Intercept’s reporting, Moro <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/leaked-carwash-messages-spark-calls-for-moro-to-resign-in-brazil">is facing growing calls</a> to step down from public office, including from the Brazilian Bar Association, which called for his suspension and for an investigation to be conducted.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 11, 2019<br />\n</strong><em>This story was updated to include comment from Sen.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>We Build the Wall,</u> the crowdfunded, ultra-right group that put up a multimillion-dollar border wall just west of El Paso in southern New Mexico, has said that it only builds on private land. But earlier this month, the group extended its wall onto government land — without asking first for government permission.</p>\n<p>The extension is a wall with a locking gate that has closed a federal road next to the Rio Grande, at the intersection of Mexico, Texas, and New Mexico. Beyond the gate is a storied monument celebrating binational cooperation known as Monument One. For decades, it has been visited by locals who’ve enjoyed the area as a park. A We Build the Wall supporter last week said that the only people allowed to unlock the gate would be employees of the Border Patrol, the owner of the adjacent American Eagle Brick Company, and the International Boundary and Water Commission.</p>\n<p>We Build the Wall adviser Steve Bannon bragged last month that the private border wall, which now snakes for almost a half-mile up a mountain, had for months been planned in secret, so as not to give protesters or civil rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union time to mount challenges. Heavy equipment started rumbling onto the property in late May, as land co-owner Jeff Allen forbade the media and the curious from getting near enough to see what was going on.</p>\n<p>Allen did permit a group of armed vigilantes known as the United Constitutional Patriots to freely roam his property, where they captured and harangued immigrants, and livestreamed <a href="https://theappeal.org/border-patrol-in-new-mexico-stood-by-as-right-wing-militia-terrorized-migrants/">their sadistic activities</a> on Facebook.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="immigrants" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>We Build the Wall’s secrecy allowed it to erect the wall without performing environmental impact studies or receiving building permits. The small, impoverished, and mostly Latinx city of Sunland Park, New Mexico, after initially resisting the illegal wall-building, eventually <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/31/private-border-wall/">gave in</a> after a barrage of phone calls, death threats, and harassment.</p>\n<p>IBWC has seemed open to the  right-wing lobbying group’s taking over of federal land and since June 2 has entertained giving We Build the Wall a permit. After nine days of waffling, the federal agency took action Monday to keep the gate open. In response, We Build the Wall has begun a bullying campaign against IBWC.</p>\n<h3>A Sensitive, Historic Site</h3>\n<p>On May 31, the new wall was feted on site by right-wing supporters, including anti-immigration politicians Kris Kobach and Tom Tancredo. The next day, Jim Benvie — formerly a leader of the United Constitutional Patriots vigilante group and now active in a spinoff called the Guardian Patriots — livestreamed migrants walking past the wall. They were headed into New Mexico to surrender to Border Patrol agents and request asylum. “A group of illegals just pushed across our construction site!” tweeted Brian Kolfage, founder of We Build the Wall. Benvie told his Facebook audience that We Build the Wall would soon be blocking the road that the migrants had used — the IBWC road.</p>\n<p>On June 2, according to IBWC public affairs spokesperson Lori Kuczmanski, employees working near the Rio Grande saw the extension being prepared. That afternoon, IBWC received an emailed request for a permit to block the road. The permit application was incomplete, and IBWC Commissioner Jayne Harkins told the construction company that “the gate needs to stay open.”</p>\n<p>But building began immediately. Kuczmanski said the agency asked We Build the Wall to halt construction, but the next day the construction on the gate was completed, locking the IBWC off its own land. Mike Furey, a construction foreman, told the media that Harkins had approved it. For several days thereafter, the IBWC asked We Build the Wall to keep the gate open, but it remained closed.</p>\n<p>Historically, the IBWC has promoted binational friendship and cooperation. Founded in 1889, the agency works with its Mexican counterpart, the Comisión Internacional de Límites y Aguas, to manage irrigation and drinking water for both countries. The U.S. and Mexican commissioners meet regularly to discuss their shared stakes in the Rio Grande and Colorado and Tijuana rivers.</p>\n<p>IBWC’s management of rivers entails stewardship of the larger environment. But the potential environmental ramifications of the new wall remain unclear. With We Build the Wall failing to complete an environmental assessment, scientists and policymakers can only estimate the potential damage to the area from mudslides, erosion, and air and water pollution caused by the displacement of contaminated soil.</p>\n<p>Furey, the foreman, was quick to point out how close the new wall is to the Rio Grande. What he ignored are the risks associated with a massive build directly uphill from the American Dam, which diverts drinking and irrigation water to Mexico and West Texas farmland. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Rio Grande is highly endangered. It suffers from over-extraction of water, pollution, and high usage. To further complicate things, the remains of the ASARCO smelter, an EPA-declared Superfund site, sit a stone’s throw from the new wall.</p>\n<p>ASARCO processed lead, zinc, silver, and copper from 1887 through 1999 in El Paso. Sulfur dioxide and heavy metals billowed out of the company’s giant smokestacks, with lead and arsenic contaminating soil and groundwater throughout the area. At one point, the Centers for Disease Control found that more than half of the children living within a mile of the smelter had blood lead levels dangerously higher than the acceptable limit. The American Eagle Brick Company, site of the wall, sits less than a third of a mile from ASARCO’s former plant.</p>\n<p>In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency named the American Dam site a spot of high contamination. A 2015 study demonstrated that the force of demolishing the ASARCO smokestacks enlarged the contaminated area, and found higher levels of lead in 2015 than had been recorded in 1993 and 2001. These findings suggest that bulldozing contaminated dirt releases toxins into the air and water.</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to We Build the Wall’s construction work, tons of dirt from the contamination zone have been bulldozed. Environmental experts agree that the dirt will make its way into the Rio Grande, although it is too early to fully assess hazardous effects. Without an environmental impact assessment, one El Paso-based hydrologist told The Intercept, the long-term repercussions are &#8220;anyone&#8217;s guess.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-254397" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/20190606-_DSC5809-1560188877.jpg" alt="20190606-_DSC5809-1560188877" /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">Monument One, which marks the boundary between the U.S. and Mexico, on June 6, 2019.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Jordyn Rozensky/Frontera Studio</p></div>\n<h3>Decades of Community History</h3>\n<p>The natural environment is not the only aspect of the border region that is endangered by the private wall. Border society is also an ecology. Binational human culture, people’s ease with living in and loving two countries, is seriously endangered by the increasing depredations of border militarization.</p>\n<p>Monument One, also known as International Boundary Marker No. 1, was established more than 160 years ago, before the Civil War. It defined the first surveyor’s point on the land border from New Mexico to California.</p>\n<p>Local historians and policymakers began lobbying for a binational park on the marker site as early as 1938, and their efforts paid off in December 1972, when a landscaped park was dedicated much to the delight of Mexican and American citizens. Two bronze plaques, one in English and one in Spanish, were placed among flowers and trees planted by community garden groups. Dignitaries from Juarez, El Paso, and Sunland Park spoke of the importance of unity over division, marveling at the shared land and pointing toward a future of continued solidarity and partnership.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the monument has been known as a quiet piece of history. It’s famous as a unique spot to snap a photo of oneself in two countries while also enjoying the stark beauty of the high desert mountains. In the summer, Mexican families travel there after spending the afternoon splashing and fishing in the Rio Grande. On the U.S. side, hikers and naturalists have used the federal levee road to watch birds, fish, and visit Monument One.</p>\n<p>The road partly belongs to the IBWC, but other sections are owned by George Cudahy and Jeff Allen, who are now the hosts for We Build the Wall’s construction. At least since 2017, the two have been intermittently chasing visitors off the road. On June 7, a local ACLU lawyer tried to visit the monument, but was <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLUNM/status/1137132269364162560">turned away by Allen</a> amid a stream of epithets.</p>\n<p>The IBWC has been slow to challenge this private blockade. When it finally took action this week, We Build the Wall and its militia allies launched a vicious attack on the agency, using tactics similar to those they lobbed against Sunland Park.</p>\n<p>On Monday, IBWC, accompanied by sheriff deputies, opened the gate and, according to Kuczmanski, told We Build the Wall that any tampering with the gate would be “considered trespassing and further action will be taken.” We Build the Wall reacted with outrage. The group called for the firing of Commissioner Harkins and mobilized supporters. Kolfage fulminated on his Twitter feed that the opening of the gate was due to the IBWC’s being “half owned by Mexico,” and Benvie live-streamed on Facebook that if the IBWC and the ACLU “want a war, they’ll get war.”</p>\n<p>But the agency has called only for the gate to remain open – it has taken no action to tear it down. Nor has the IBWC shown regard for the surrounding community’s history.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people keep asking me and calling me,” Kuczmanski, the agency’s public affairs officer, told The Intercept. She said they are insisting that Monument One is a park. “It’s not a park,” she said.</p>\n<p>Since the wall was erected, tourists have continued to visit Monument One on the Mexico side, said Mexican police who patrol the area. But if they step too close to the wall, they are intimidated by people just over the line on the U.S. side. There have been incidents, according to Mexican authorities, of verbal harassment shouted through the slots of the bollards by construction workers and others.</p>\n<p>Days after the wall went up, congressional Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso spoke to the El Paso Times and condemned the wall’s hosts for “furthering this xenophobic narrative.” She called the wall “necessary fuel” for Trump’s further political ambitions. El Paso City Rep. Peter Svarzbein evoked the wounding of the binational psyche, saying that he was concerned that public access to Monument One would be interrupted. He called the monument a “federal park that highlights the best of the values, culture, and history of our community here on the border.”</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, We Build the Wall promotes its multimillion-dollar structure as a model alternative to Trump’s stymied, public-works wall project. That rhetoric has seduced Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, a border native who staunchly opposes publicly funded walls. CNN recently asked him about the wall and the people who erected it. “What you do on your private property, including building a wall, is your business,” O’Rourke <a href="https://www.facebook.com/debbie.nathan.31/videos/vb.705307034/10156021036432035/?type=2&amp;theater&amp;notif_t=video_processed&amp;notif_id=1560174090862">said</a>. “Good for them.”</p>\n<p>Border residents who do know the area and hold it dear have tried to explain why few organizations so far have protested the new wall or the blocking of Monument One. Some cite safety concerns, knowing of We Build the Wall’s connection to an armed militia. Only the ACLU of New Mexico has taken action, asking the public to call and write to the IBWC. “You have a private group that is allowed to appropriate federal land to carry out a political purpose,” said director Peter Simonson. He said the ACLU is still analyzing the situation to determine its next steps. Meanwhile, the public&#8217;s access to Monument One remains fraught.</p>\n<p>A public middle school teacher, Tom Wilson, said he has hiked and bicycled the area with his family for over 30 years and is now furious and grief-stricken at the prospect of being banished from Monument One.</p>\n<p>“For a long time now,” Wilson said, “Trump’s sons of bitches have declared this area ground zero in the war on immigrants. It’s exhausting. It never stops, and one thing follows another so fast. There’s a weariness here now. The border is our heritage, but people are tired. They shrug their shoulders and say, What’s next?”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/11/private-border-wall-federal-land/">Private Border Wall Expands Onto Federal Land, Blocking Access to Historic Site</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>A member of</u> Project Veritas gave testimony in a federal court case indicating that the right-wing group, known for its undercover videos, violates Facebook policies designed to counter systematic deception by Russian troll farms and other groups. The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.178412/gov.uscourts.mad.178412.126.1.pdf">deposition</a> raises questions over whether Facebook will deter American operatives who use the platform to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/29/project-veritas-how-fake-news-prize-went-to-rightwing-group-beloved-by-trump">strategically deceive and damage political opponents</a> as vigorously as it has Iranian and Russian propagandists. But is the company capable of doing so without just creating more problems?</p>\n<p>Close observers of Veritas and Facebook, including one at a research lab that works with the social network, said the testimony shows the group is clearly violating policies against what Facebook refers to as “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” The company formally defined such behavior in a <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/">December 2018 video</a> featuring its cybersecurity policy chief Nathaniel Gleicher, who said it “is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they’re doing.” The designation, Gleicher added, is applied by Facebook to a group not “because of the content they’re sharing” but rather only “because of their deceptive behavior.” That is, using Facebook to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/womans-effort-to-infiltrate-the-washington-post-dates-back-months/2017/11/29/ce95e01a-d51e-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.bc12e8cee3b1">dupe people</a> is all it takes to fit the company’s institutional definition of coordinated inauthentic behavior.</p>\n<p>In practice, “coordinated inauthentic behavior” has become a sort of catchall label for untoward meddling on Facebook, snagging everyone from Burmese military officers to Russian meme spammers. But curbing such activity has become a very public crusade for Facebook in the wake of its prominent role as a platform for the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and outright hoaxes during the 2016 presidential campaign. This past January, Gleicher <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/removing-cib-iran/">announced</a> the removal of coordinated inauthentic behavior from Iran, which spread when operatives “coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves,” thus triggering a Facebook ban. Similarly, in a 2017 update on Facebook’s internal investigation into Russian online propaganda efforts, the company’s then-head of security Alex Stamos <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/">assured the world’s democracies</a> the company was providing “technology improvements for detecting fake accounts,” including “changes to help us more efficiently detect and stop inauthentic accounts at the time they are being created.”</p>\n<p>Throughout all of this, coordinated inauthentic behavior has remained more or less synonymous with “foreign actors” and “nation-states,” the cloak-and-dagger stuff of an increasingly militarized internet filled with enemies of the Western Democracy who seek to subvert it from abroad.</p>\n<p>Project Veritas, a hybrid of an opposition research shop and a ranting YouTube channel, has taken pride in its ability to deceive since its creation in 2010. With conservative backers like <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/09/22/conservative-facebook-investor-funded-anti-acorn-videographer/">Peter Thiel</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/project-veritas-received-17-million-last-year-from-koch-backed-charity/2017/12/01/143e13ca-d6d3-11e7-9461-ba77d604373d_story.html">Koch brothers</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-foundation-paid-activist-filmmaker-james-o-keefe-n670381">Trump Foundation</a>, the group and its founder James O’Keefe have worked relentlessly to target and malign individuals at institutions they deem leftist, whether it’s Planned Parenthood (reportedly targeted by O&#8217;Keefe<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/04/james-okeefe-undercover-sting-profile-feature-2018-218015"> posing as a young teen&#8217;s 23-year-old boyfriend</a>), George Soros (the progressive philanthropist whose professional circle Veritas tried and<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/james-okeefe-accidentally-stings-himself"> spectacularly failed to infiltrate</a>), or the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.53061302d6db">Washington Post</a> (whose reporter was offered a fake story on Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore). O’Keefe has long attempted to position himself in the context of dogged, daring, traditional journalism, describing Veritas’s efforts as “investigative” reporting executed by “undercover journalists.” But his efforts are often executed by what the New Yorker has called “amateurish spies” — their efforts against the Post and Soros resembled a Three Stooges bit — and packaged with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134525412/Segments-Of-NPR-Gotcha-Video-Taken-Out-Of-Context">mendacious editing</a>, duplicitous production, and outright lying, making Veritas’s audience as much a victim of its productions as the subjects. Debates over who or what is to be considered “real journalism” are almost always counterproductive and contrived, but Veritas stands out for the shamelessness with which it pursues nakedly partisan ends.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, a proud tradition of undercover journalism executed unequivocally in the name of informing the public. Writers like Barbara Ehrenreich and Shane Bauer have taken jobs they were not otherwise interested in in order to reveal injustices in society&#8217;s margins, and some of the most damning details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal were <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/exposed-undercover-secrets-of-donald-trump-data-firm-cambridge-analytica">exposed</a> by a reporter with the UK&#8217;s Channel 4 posing as a foreign politician interested in the company&#8217;s services. This reporting involved lying, sure — or at least the withholding of true intent, and a willingness to let others deceive themselves — but only as a means to a truthful end. The distinction between these reporters and Veritas operatives may be that the end the latter group seeks, the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-a-hollywood-hit-job-how-sting-artist-james-okeefe-tried-to-set-his-latest-trap-and-got-stung-himself">final media product</a>, is <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-648R">typically</a> just another act of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/01/james-okeefe-to-step-up-political-stalking/">partisan misdirection that doesn&#8217;t withstand further scrutiny</a>.</p>\n<p>Neither Project Veritas nor Facebook commented for this story.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Legend Building&#8221; by Project Veritas</h3>\n<p>Project Veritas has <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/11/28/reminder-james-okeefe-has-a-history-of-failing-to-discredit-journalists/">systematically deceived</a> not just <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-okeefe-juan-carlos-vera_n_2832338">targets on the left</a> and <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/fact-check-political-video-misleading">viewers on the right</a> but Facebook users as well (their official page has over 200,000 followers) at a time when the company is publicly dedicated to fighting this sort of systemic duplicity. That’s a wrinkle that raises questions about Facebook’s commitment to rooting out coordinated inauthentic behavior closer to home — Thiel sits on the company’s board — not to mention Project Veritas’s presence on social media.</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;We thus have the admission of intent by the organization and evidence of action by multiple of its agents.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>In 2017, O’Keefe sued the Suffolk County district attorney over a Massachusetts law barring the covert recording of government officials. This past December, a federal judge overturned the rule. But in the course of the lawsuit, Joe Halderman, a member of the Project Veritas inner circle who was previously convicted of trying to extort late night television host David Letterman in 2010, sat for a deposition. In it, Halderman was compelled to submit to a sworn interrogation of Veritas methods. Just how does one go about duping savvy politicos and the politico-adjacent in the 21st century?</p>\n<p>During his deposition, Halderman, Project Veritas’s self-described “executive producer,” stated under oath that the organization falsifies Facebook accounts as part of its overall strategy of deceiving the targets of its investigations. Halderman, characterizing himself as “integrally involved in [Project Veritas’s] investigations and have been since I started four years ago,” describes the work that went into setting up Robert Creamer, a Democratic operative recorded by Veritas in a 2016. That video attempted to portray Creamer as complicit in a Hillary Clinton-led campaign to violently disrupt Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign events with counterprotests and engaging in counter-Trump voter fraud — both regular, unfounded talking points repeated by Trump on the campaign trail. Last year, the Wisconsin Department of Justice concluded an investigation into the videos, determining that they “reveal no evidence of election fraud,” the Associated Press reported.</p>\n<p>But before Veritas could get Creamer on camera, they needed to make contact via a fake persona, Halderman explained. Per the transcript (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote><p>Q. And you spoke earlier about PVA [Veritas] creating this donor, Charles. When you say create the donor, what did PVA do to create the donor?</p>\n<p>A. So, I thought of a name. I talked to the undercover journalist who was the person who met with Foval. We between us sort of created this story of this person. I got some business cards made. I got an e-mail. I set up an e-mail account. What else did I do? I think that&#8217;s about all I did.</p>\n<p>Again, in this particular case, we didn&#8217;t feel like they were going to get seriously vetted. In some investigations we do legend building because we believe or our concern is that we&#8217;re going to be vetted reasonably, you know, by open source information.</p>\n<p><b>So, we&#8217;ll create a Facebook page</b>, a LinkedIn page. We&#8217;ve even gone so far in the past of creating LLCs, offshore bank accounts. We do a lot of things because undercover journalism is a tricky, complicated business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lauren Windsor, a political organizer and <a href="https://democracypartners.com/partners/lauren-windsor">partner at Democracy Partners</a> (alongside Robert Creamer) who began documenting Veritas’s team of “undercover” operatives and their various aliases after her own organization was infiltrated, this sort of use of phony social accounts is the group’s standard operating procedure. “In conducting extensive outreach to victims and extensive research of social media networks to build the vetting resource website <a href="https://www.projectveritas.exposed/"><span lang="en-US">Project Veritas Exposed</span></a>,&#8221; explained Windsor, &#8220;I documented several instances of PV violating Facebook’s terms by creating fake profiles. We thus have the admission of intent by the organization and evidence of action by multiple of its agents.”</p>\n<p>Windsor’s work includes cataloging Project Veritas&#8217;s network of fake Facebook accounts; Windsor provided screenshots to The Intercept. In one example, Veritas operative Marisa Jorge’s likeness is used for the Facebook profile of “Ava-Marie Joyce.” The bio of the Ava-Marie persona bizarrely describes herself as “Carrie Tallinn, a self-employed professional women’s right activist.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2018 lawsuit <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/07/23/project-veritas-lawsuit-american-federation-of-teachers/">reported</a> by The Intercept last year, Jorge previously misrepresented herself as a University of Michigan student in order to gain improper access to teachers union documents. The friends list for “Ava-Marie Joyce” lists another profile fabricated by Project Veritas, “Ava Marie Allen.”</p>\n<p>Another screenshot shows a Facebook profile for “Tyler Marshall,” which O’Keefe himself disclosed as a fabricated identity in his 2018 book “American Pravda.” In a section of that book (subtitle: “My Fight For Truth in the Era of Fake News”) detailing Veritas’s attempts to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/meetings-of-activists-planning-to-disrupt-inauguration-were-infiltrated-by-conservative-media-group/2017/01/24/b22128fe-e19a-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.67af0c45d3ca">infiltrate protestors planning action</a> around Trump&#8217;s presidential inauguration, O’Keefe wrote that his operatives all “of course, establish a social media presence under their assumed names—‘Tyler Marshall,’ say, or ‘Adam Stevens.’ The presence includes Twitter, Facebook, and email at the least.”</p>\n<h3>Exploitation of Facebook by a Group Linked To Military Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, said Veritas’s homegrown social media deception is a clear violation of Facebook’s policy. After reading the deposition, Brooking told The Intercept, “Mr. Halderman describes the creation of fake Facebook personas for the purpose of deception” and “implies that this is a regular and systematic practice. Under any reasonable definition, Project Veritas is engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior and abuse of the Facebook platform.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-left\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'left\'>&#8220;Under any reasonable definition, Project Veritas is engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior and abuse of the Facebook platform.”</blockquote>\n<p>Brooking’s group, a frequently cited authority on online electoral interference and other digital propaganda campaigns, entered into an official partnership with Facebook last year. A Facebook director <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/announcing-new-election-partnership-with-the-atlantic-council/">wrote at the time</a> that experts at the lab “will work closely with our security, policy and product teams to get Facebook real-time insights and updates on emerging threats and disinformation campaigns from around the world.”</p>\n<p>If it sounds like a stretch to compare Project Veritas to a Russian troll farm, consider the group&#8217;s links to the U.S. defense establishment. As The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/03/erik-prince-trump-uae-project-veritas/">reported in May</a>, Veritas members underwent “intelligence and elicitation techniques from a retired military intelligence operative named Euripides Rubio Jr.,” personally arranged by the infamous American mercenary and Trump adviser Erik Prince. What we have here, then, is a 2016 military intelligence-linked, organized effort to undermine the Democratic Party and boost the Trump presidential campaign using falsified social media profiles. If that doesn’t sound familiar, it certainly should.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>The problem with Facebook and its peers has never been identifying abuses and misuses, whether truly dangerous or merely toxic; Facebook, Twitter, and Google alone represent perhaps history&#8217;s greatest living catalog of antisocial behavior, a frenzy of rule violation on a mass scale. Whether these companies deem comprehensive content moderation simply too expensive or not worth the public relations mess, the fact is that the public rarely sees movement on these issues in the absence of congressional scolding or media uproar.</p>\n<p>The real issue is uneven, arbitrary enforcement of &#8220;the rules.&#8221; Max Read, <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/carlos-maza-and-stephen-crowder-show-youtube-has-one-rule.html">writing in New York magazine</a> on another social network&#8217;s enforcement blunders, argued that &#8220;the problem for YouTube is that for rules to be taken seriously by the people they govern, they need to be applied consistently and clearly.&#8221; YouTube is about as terrible at this exercise as Facebook is, and there&#8217;s a good chance that if Facebook treated malicious right-wing American exploitation of its network the same way it treats malicious foreign exploitation of its network, it would probably botch the whole thing and end up burning people who actually do use phony Facebook profiles<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/us/politics/facebook-first-amendment.html"> for work toward the public good</a>.</p>\n<p>That a company like Facebook is even in a position to create &#8220;rules&#8221; like the coordinated inauthentic behavior policy that apply to a large chunk of the Earth&#8217;s population is itself a serious problem, one made considerably worse by completely erratic enforcement. It&#8217;s bad enough having a couple guys in California take up the banner of defending &#8220;Democracy&#8221; around the world through the exclusive control of one of the most powerful information organs in human history; if nothing else, we should hope their decisions are predictable and consistent.</p>\n<p>Correction: June 11th, 2019, 11:19 a.m.</p>\n<p>This article has been updated to name Lauren Windsor’s employer, Democracy Partners, where she is a partner.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/11/facebook-rules-project-veritas/">Right-Wing Sting Group Project Veritas Is Breaking Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Authentic Behavior&#8221; Rule.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>In January 2017,</u> three days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a businessman from the United Arab Emirates was invited to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-opulent-trump-inaugural-dinner-designed-as-a-glittery-overture-to-foreign-diplomats/2019/03/14/e20c8482-3f5d-11e9-a0d3-1210e58a94cf_story.html?utm_term=.591260a3cb31">a lavish dinner</a> planned by Trump&#8217;s longtime ally Thomas J. Barrack Jr., who was chair of the president&#8217;s inaugural committee. The guest list placed Rashid al-Malik, a onetime business associate of Barrack’s, amid more than 100 foreign diplomats and top members of the incoming administration. The president-elect himself made a surprise appearance at the gathering.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik’s name later surfaced in connection with a federal probe into potential <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html">illegal donations to Trump’s inaugural fund and a pro-Trump Super PAC by Middle Eastern donors</a>. Al-Malik was interviewed by members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s team and was “cooperating” with prosecutors, his lawyer told The Intercept last year. The New York Times recently reported that investigators are looking into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/world/middleeast/crown-prince-mohammed-bin-zayed.html">whether Mr. al-Malik was part of an illegal influence scheme</a>,” although no details of that potential scheme have been made public.</p>\n<p>In fact, the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that al-Malik served as a paid intelligence source for the UAE throughout 2017, The Intercept has learned.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="killing" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>Al-Malik reported to UAE intelligence about aspects of the Trump administration’s Middle East policy, according to a former U.S. official and documents viewed by The Intercept. The National Intelligence Service of the UAE gave al-Malik a code name and paid him tens of thousands of dollars a month to gather information, a role for which his investment business would have provided a convenient cover.</p>\n<p>After he was interviewed as part of the Mueller investigation, al-Malik left Los Angeles, where he’d been based for several years, and went back to the UAE.</p>\n<p>A former Dubai aerospace executive and chair of the investment firm Hayah Holdings, al-Malik was tasked to report to his Emirati intelligence handlers on topics of consequence to the UAE, such as attitudes within the Trump administration toward the Muslim Brotherhood; U.S. efforts to mediate the ongoing feud between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar; and meetings between senior U.S. officials and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose rise to power has been loudly championed by the UAE and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik also told his handlers that he had approached unnamed U.S. individuals about a possible business venture that was indirectly associated with Trump. It is not clear what the undertaking was, who al-Malik was talking to, or whether any deal was made.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik “is not an intelligence operative,” his attorney, Bill Coffield, of Berliner Corcoran &amp; Rowe, told The Intercept. “Mr. al-Malik is a businessman involved in many business projects, and he is regularly paid for business consulting,” Coffield wrote in an email. “He has NEVER been paid to report on the Trump Administration. He has never been ‘tasked’ to deliver information about the inner workings of the Trump administration.”</p>\n<p>U.S. counterintelligence officials regularly monitor foreign governments’ efforts to influence U.S. policy, but an operation by the UAE would be particularly sensitive for the Trump administration, and would underscore the hazards posed by a president whose ongoing business ties expose him to potential conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization has made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/business/trump-golf-course-dubai.html">millions per year</a> off a Trump-branded golf course in Dubai. Shortly after he was elected, Trump bragged that he turned down a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-says-he-turned-down-2-billion-deal-in-dubai-but-didnt-have-to/2017/01/11/f9092f56-d82f-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html?utm_term=.3fb31c762200">$2 billion deal</a> from his Dubai-based business partner, Hussain Sajwani.</p>\n<p>It is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/951">against the law</a> for anyone other than a diplomatic or consular official to operate inside the United States on behalf of a foreign government without first notifying the Justice Department, though the law includes exceptions for “officially and publicly acknowledged and sponsored” foreign government representatives and those “engaged in a legal commercial transaction.” Earlier this year, Russian national Maria Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to form “backchannel” connections between conservative U.S. officials and the Kremlin as an undisclosed agent of the Russian government. She was sentenced to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/maria-butina-russian-who-conspired-to-infiltrate-the-nra-due-for-sentencing/2019/04/25/3ff24216-66ce-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html?utm_term=.aafb67ae1caf">18 months in prison</a> and will be deported when she has completed her sentence.</p>\n<p>The White House declined to comment, referring questions to the CIA and the Justice Department, both of which also declined to comment. The UAE Embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Among the Emirati government officials overseeing al-Malik was Ali al-Shamsi, director of the Emirati National Intelligence Service, according to The Intercept&#8217;s sources. A source who knows al-Shamsi described him as “more than just a spy. He’s also a discreet messenger” for Mohammed bin Zayed, known as MBZ, and his brother Tahnoun bin Zayed, the UAE’s national security adviser.</p>\n<p>“Al-Shamsi and the Emirati government clearly think they can influence Trump by doing business with him,” said a person with direct knowledge of UAE intelligence operations who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.</p>\n<p><u></u><div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253845" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_17135646364787-trump-mbz-1559952086.jpg" alt="President Donald Trump welcomes Abu Dhabi\'s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to the White House in Washington, Monday, May 15, 2017.

He has openly shared his beliefs that the best way to forge a stronger bond is through economic prosperity.”</p>\n<p>Al-Malik “has, on numerous occasions, discussed various business ideas for UAE projects in the U.S.,&#8221; Coffield continued. &#8220;He has consistently discussed highlighting the economic benefits of UAE investment in the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation, as a way to foster a better relationship between the citizens of both countries. His discussions also included the benefits for both countries’ leadership.”</p>\n<p>A tiny country of fewer than 10 million people, the UAE does not have a robust intelligence service, but has used businesspeople and wealthy citizens with personal relationships with its royal families as assets to carry out secret intelligence-gathering missions for the government, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik was likely enlisted as a spy “because he has pre-existing access, a natural role,” said the person with knowledge of UAE intelligence operations.</p>\n<p>Coffield did not respond to The Intercept’s request to interview al-Malik.</p>\n<p>Whether or not al-Malik’s efforts succeeded, the small, oil-rich Gulf nation has indisputably triumphed during the Trump presidency, as its top foreign policy goals have repeatedly won Trump’s personal backing. In 2017, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/06/qatar-panic-buying-as-shoppers-stockpile-food-due-to-saudi-blockade">tweeted in support</a> of Saudi and UAE efforts to isolate their Gulf rival Qatar, publicly contradicting his own cabinet. With Congressional opposition holding up arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE after Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered by a hit team in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Trump administration <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/24/us-saudi-arabia-arms-sales/">invoked an obscure emergency provision</a> to allow the deals to go forward. Trump also <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/18/trump-veto-yemen-saudi-arabia-mbs/">vetoed</a> a resolution that would have ended U.S. military support for the Saudi- and UAE-led intervention in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians; his White House has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/trump-muslim-brotherhood.html">pushed to designate the Muslim Brotherhood</a> a foreign terrorist organization, a move that has long been sought by the UAE and its Gulf allies.</p>\n<p><u>Little is publicly</u> known about al-Malik, who began his career as a pilot for Emirates, Dubai’s government-owned airline. He came to the U.S. in 1998 to study aviation at Western Michigan University and was honored by the UAE Embassy in Washington for scholastic achievement in the program, according to a profile on an <a href="http://www.arabaviation.com/IndustryResources/WhosWho/tabid/54/ItemId/502/Rashid-Al-Malik.aspx">industry website</a>. But he left the university in 2000 without receiving a degree, according to the Western Michigan registrar’s office.</p>\n<p>Al-Malik worked as an Emirates pilot from 2000 to 2006, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashid-al-malik-19bbaa11/?originalSubdomain=ae">his LinkedIn page</a>, before becoming an executive at Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, a government-funded company that leases aircraft. Al-Malik left that job in 2008, and now runs Hayah Holdings.</p>\n<p>It is unclear when and how al-Malik met Barrack, a billionaire investor who was one of Trump’s top fundraisers during the 2016 campaign. But in 2013, al-Malik and Barrack, who is executive chair of Colony Capital, Inc., tried to partner on <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/04/10/quan-dubai-prince-partnering-on-oaklands-coliseum-city/">a real estate deal</a> to revitalize downtown Oakland and possibly build new sports stadiums and hotels. Colony Capital and Hayah Holdings formed a joint investment venture called Bay Investment Group LLC, but the deal ultimately fell through.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253840" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-631421232-1559951301.jpg" alt="Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Barrack, founder of Colony Capital LLC and chairman of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\'s inaugural committee, speaks to members of the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017.

The Times reported last summer that Barrack’s company has raised more than $7 billion in new investments since Trump won the Republican nomination, with roughly a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/world/middleeast/trump-tom-barrack-saudi.html">quarter of the money</a> coming from Gulf states.</p>\n<p>Barrack has also cultivated a friendly relationship with <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/23/yousef-al-otaiba-khashoggi-washington/">Yousef al-Otaiba</a>, the UAE’s powerful ambassador to the United States. In April 2016, months after then-candidate Trump proposed a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” al-Otaiba wrote to Barrack saying that “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/world/middleeast/trump-tom-barrack-saudi.html">confusion about your friend Donald Trump is VERY high</a>” and “has many people extremely worried,” according to email correspondence published by the Times and other outlets.</p>\n<p>Barrack sought to reassure al-Otaiba, saying that Trump “also has joint ventures in the U.A.E.!” He added, “We can turn him to prudence &#8211; he needs a few really smart Arab minds to whom he can confer &#8211; u r at the top of that list!”</p>\n<p>Al-Otaiba was also on the guest list for the Chairman’s Global Dinner, the extravagant inaugural event to which al-Malik was invited. The dinner was unusual not just because of its opulence but because it seated so many foreign businesspeople and diplomats alongside future cabinet-level officials, providing direct access to members of the incoming administration.</p>\n<p>A week after Trump won the election, al-Otaiba sought insider information from Barrack. “If you have any insights about postings to places like state, DOD, CIA and national security adviser, I would be grateful,” al-Otaiba emailed Barrack on November 16, 2016, <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/donald-trump-campaign-and-uae-emails-yousef-otaiba-tom-barrack-reveal-sharing-information-2016-election-saudi-9/11-1631521788">according to Middle East Eye</a>. “I would only brief my bosses. Any indicators would be highly appreciated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Barrack responded, “I do, and we’re working through them in real time and I have our regional interest in high profile.

Instead, he stayed with his investment firm, which contemplated a plan to channel his foreign connections into lucrative deals that would support Trump administration policy.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit">published a February 2017 memo</a> from Barrack’s firm, Colony Capital, then known as Colony Northstar, outlining the scheme to leverage connections to the Trump administration and foreign VIPs for profit. The plan was reportedly written by Rick Gates, Paul Manafort’s longtime associate, who served as deputy chair of the inaugural committee and then as a Colony consultant. Gates was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-30/rick-gates-terminated-by-barrack-s-colony-following-indictment">fired by Colony</a> after being indicted in the Mueller probe; he ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the Washington DC office is to expand Colony Northstar’s global footprint and build a bridge to where government and business intersect globally,” the memo says. “The key is to strategically cultivate domestic and international relations while avoiding any appearance of lobbying.” The memo notes that no other company “can currently match the relationships and resources that we possess.” A Colony spokesperson told ProPublica that the plan was “never acted upon or implemented.”</p>\n<p>A source close to Barrack told The Intercept that al-Malik and Barrack spoke several times in 2018, but that Barrack did not have any current business deals with al-Malik.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>There is no indication that Barrack knew about al-Malik’s intelligence role. But Tommy Davis, a former chief of staff to Barrack who represents him as a spokesperson, was aware that al-Malik had connections to the UAE government.</p>\n<p>“I know for a fact that Rashid has been on retainer since the day I met him, and he’s always been clear about that,” Davis told The Intercept. “That’s who pays for his car, that’s who pays for where he lives. And his job is to be on retainer and to find and consummate real estate deals in the United States.”</p>\n<p>Hayah Holdings does not appear to have a website or a physical address in Dubai, but documents from the city of Oakland described it as a “a private investment company based in Dubai with strong financial ties in the Gulf region.”</p>\n<p>“Mr. Malik formed Hayah Holdings to help identify investment and development opportunities in established markets such as the United States and Europe,” according to a 2013 document from the Oakland city administrator’s office. “Their focus has primarily been on large mixed-use real estate developments, especially those of a transformational nature and with a significant sport, entertainment content and infrastructure related opportunities [sic].”</p>\n<p>Jean Quan, who was mayor of Oakland when the deal was being considered, said she was told that the financing came from Emirati royals. “What was conveyed to me at the time was that the money for the deal was going to come from the Dubai royal family,” Quan told The Intercept.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/10/trump-uae-businessman-spy/">UAE Enlisted Businessman to Spy On Trump White House</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>A large trove</u> of documents furnished exclusively to The Intercept Brasil reveals serious ethical violations and legally prohibited collaboration between the judge and prosecutors who last year <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/24/lula-brazil-corruption-conviction-car-wash/">convicted</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/13/brazil-lula-prison-generals-military-coup/">imprisoned</a> former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on corruption charges — a conviction that resulted in Lula being barred from the 2018 presidential election. These materials also contain evidence that the prosecution had serious doubts about whether there was sufficient evidence to establish Lula’s guilt.</p>\n<p>The archive, provided to The Intercept by an anonymous source, includes years of internal files and private conversations from the prosecutorial team behind Brazil&#8217;s sprawling Operation Car Wash, an ongoing corruption investigation that has yielded dozens of major convictions, including those of top corporate executives and powerful politicians.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="secret-brazil-archive" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>In the files, conversations between lead prosecutor Deltan Dallagnol and then-presiding Judge Sergio Moro reveal that Moro offered strategic advice to prosecutors and passed on tips for new avenues of investigation. With these actions, Moro grossly overstepped the ethical lines that define the role of a judge. In Brazil, as in the United States, judges are required to be impartial and neutral, and are barred from secretly collaborating with one side in a case.</p>\n<p>Other chats in the archive raise fundamental questions about the quality of the charges that ultimately sent Lula to prison. He was accused of having received a beachfront triplex apartment from a contractor as a kickback for facilitating multimillion-dollar contracts with the state-controlled oil firm Petrobras. In group chats among members of the prosecutorial team just days before filing the indictment, Dallagnol expressed his increasing doubts over two key elements of the prosecution&#8217;s case: whether the triplex was in fact Lula&#8217;s and whether it had anything to do with Petrobras.</p>\n<p>These two questions were critical to their ability to prosecute Lula. Without the Petrobras link, the task force running the Car Wash investigation would have no legal basis for prosecuting this case, as it would fall outside of their jurisdiction. Even more seriously, without proving that the triplex belonged to Lula, the case itself would fall apart, since Lula’s alleged receipt of the triplex was the key ingredient to prove he acted corruptly.</p>\n<p>Operation Car Wash is one of the most consequential political forces in the history of Brazilian democracy and also one of the most controversial. It has taken down powerful actors once thought to be untouchable and revealed massive corruption schemes that sucked billions out of public coffers.</p>\n<p>The probe, however, has also been accused of political bias, repeated violations of constitutional guarantees, and illegal leaks of information to the press. (A separate article <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula">published today</a> by The Intercept reveals that the Car Wash prosecutors, who long insisted that they were apolitical and concerned solely with fighting corruption, were in fact internally plotting how to prevent the return to power by Lula and his Workers&#8217; Party).</p>\n<p>The successful prosecution of Lula rendered him ineligible to run in the 2018 presidential election at a time when all polls showed that the former president was the clear frontrunner. As a result, Operation Car Wash was scorned by Lula&#8217;s supporters, who considered it a politically motivated scheme, driven by right-wing ideologues masquerading as apolitical anti-corruption prosecutors, in order to prevent Lula from running for president and to destroy the Workers&#8217; Party.</p>\n<p>But on the Brazilian right, there was widespread popular support for the corruption probe, the team of prosecutors, and Moro. The yearslong corruption probe transformed Moro into a hero both in Brazil and around the world, a status that was only strengthened once he became the man who finally brought down Lula.</p>\n<p>After the guilty verdict from Moro was quickly affirmed by an appellate court, Lula’s candidacy was barred by law. With Lula out of the running, the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/28/jair-bolsonaro-elected-president-brazil/">far-right </a>candidate Jair Bolsonaro shot up in the polls and then <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/05/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election-stabbinng/">handily</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/10/08/brazils-bolsonaro-led-far-right-wins-a-victory-far-more-sweeping-and-dangerous-than-anyone-predicted-its-lessons-are-global/">won the presidency</a> by defeating Lula’s chosen replacement, former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro then named Moro, the judge who had presided over the case against Lula, to be his justice minister. Jurists and scholars will continue to debate the role of Car Wash for decades, but these archives offer an unprecedented window into this crucial moment in recent Brazilian history.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254032" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-942784120-moro-lava-jato-1560058067.jpg" alt="View of a truck with a portrait of Brazilian judge Sergio Moro reading &quot;Long live Lava Jato&quot;, referring to an anti-corrption operation, during a protest against Brazilian former president (2003-2011) Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva outside the Federal Police headquarters, where he is awaited to start his 12-year prison sentence in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.

" /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">A truck with a portrait of Sergio Moro reading, &#8220;Long live Lava Jato (Car Wash),&#8221; from April 6, 2018.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<h3>Sergio Moro Crosses the Line</h3>\n<p>Telegram messages between Sergio Moro and Deltan Dallagnol reveal that Moro repeatedly stepped far outside the permissible bounds of his position as a judge while working on Car Wash cases. Over the course of more than two years, Moro suggested to the prosecutor that his team change the sequence of who they would investigate; insisted on less downtime between raids; gave strategic advice and informal tips; provided the prosecutors with advance knowledge of his decisions; offered constructive criticism of prosecutorial filings; and even scolded Dallagnol as if the prosecutor worked for the judge. Such conduct is unethical for a judge, who is responsible for maintaining neutrality to guarantee a fair trial, and it violates the Judiciary&#8217;s Code of Ethics for Brazil.</p>\n<p>In one illustrative chat, Moro, referring to new rounds of search warrants and interrogations, suggested to Dallagnol that it might be preferable to “reverse the order of the two planned [phases].&#8221;</p>\n<p>Numerous other instances in this archive reveal Moro — then a judge, and now Bolsonaro’s justice minister — actively collaborating with the prosecutors to strengthen their case. After a month of silence from the Car Wash task force, Moro asked: &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it been a long time without an operation?&#8221; In another instance, Moro said, &#8220;You cannot make that kind of mistake now&#8221; — a reference to what he considered to be an error by the Federal Police. &#8220;But think hard whether that&#8217;s a good idea… the facts would have to be serious,&#8221; he counseled after Dallagnol told him of a motion he planned to file. &#8220;What do you think of these crazy statements from the PT national board? Should we officially rebut?&#8221; he asked, using the plural — &#8220;we&#8221; — in response to criticisms of the Car Wash investigation by Lula&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party, showing that he viewed himself and the Car Wash prosecutors as united in the same cause.</p>\n<p>As in the United States, Brazil&#8217;s criminal justice system employs the accusatory model, which requires separation between the accuser and judge. Under this model, the judge must analyze the allegations of both sides in an impartial, disinterested manner. But the chats between Moro and Dallagnol show that, when he was a judge, the current justice minister improperly interfered in the Car Wash task force&#8217;s work, acting informally as an aid and advisor to the prosecution. In secret, he was helping design and construct the very criminal case that he would then “neutrally” adjudicate.</p>\n<p>Such coordination between the judge and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office outside of official proceedings squarely contradicts the public narrative that Car Wash prosecutors, Moro, and their supporters have presented and vigorously defended over the years. Moro and Dallagnol have been accused of secret collaboration since the early days of Car Wash, but these suspicions — until now — were not backed by concrete evidence.</p>\n<p>Another example of Moro crossing the line separating prosecutor and judge is in a conversation with Dallagnol on December 7, 2015, when he informally passed on a tip about Lula&#8217;s case to the prosecutors. &#8220;So. The following. Source informed me that the contact person is annoyed at having been asked to issue draft property transfer deeds for one of the ex-president&#8217;s children. Apparently the person would be willing to provide the information. I&#8217;m therefore passing it along. The source is serious,&#8221; wrote Moro.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thank you!! We&#8217;ll make contact,&#8221; Dallagnol promptly replied. Moro added, &#8220;And it would be dozens of properties.&#8221; Dallagnol later advised Moro that he called the source, but she would not talk: &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of drafting a subpoena, based on apocryphal news,&#8221; the prosecutor said. While it is not entirely clear what this means, it appears that Dallagnol was floating the idea of inventing an anonymous complaint that could be used to compel the source to testify. Moro, rather than chastise the prosecutor or remain silent, appears to endorse the proposal: &#8220;Better to formalize then,&#8221; the judge replied.</p>\n<p>Moro has publicly and vehemently denied on several occasions that he ever worked in partnership with the team of prosecutors. In a March 2016 <a href="https://youtu.be/8mMwU37tPUU?list=PLTBJf5VvlFLNnhTWhW6ngfvc4vZg3qOct&amp;t=3714">speech</a>, Moro denied these suspicions explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s make something very clear. You hear a lot about Judge Moro&#8217;s investigative strategy. [&#8230;] I do not have any investigative strategy at all. The people who investigate or who decide what to do and such is the Public Prosecutor and the [Federal] Police. The judge is reactive. We say that a judge should normally cultivate these passive virtues. And I even get irritated at times, I see somewhat unfounded criticism of my work, saying that I am a judge-investigator.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In his <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/luta-contra-corrup%C3%A7%C3%A3o-marcado-impunidade/dp/8568377106/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1559751637&amp;refinements=p_27%3ADeltan+Dallagnol&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">2017 book</a>, &#8220;The Fight Against Corruption,&#8221; Dallagnol wrote that Moro &#8220;always evaluated the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s requests in an impartial and technical manner.&#8221; Last year, in response to a complaint from Lula&#8217;s lawyers, Brazil&#8217;s prosecutor general — the presidentially-appointed chief prosecutor who runs the Car Wash investigation — <a href="http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/justica/noticia/2018-07/pgr-envia-parecer-contra-suspeicao-de-moro-para-stj">wrote</a> that Moro &#8220;remained impartial during the entire process&#8221; of Lula&#8217;s conviction.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed xtra-large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254034" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-887666420-dallagnol-1560058347.jpg" alt="Brazilian Federal Attorney Deltan Dallagnol listens, during the ceremony for the return of resources to Petrobras, which were recovered through cooperation and leniency agreements  in connection with Lava Jato operation, in Curitiba, Brazil on December 07, 2017.

They also knew that their claimed jurisdictional entitlement to prosecute Lula was shaky at best, if not entirely baseless.</p>\n<p>In the documents, Dallagnol, the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, expressed concerns regarding the two most important elements of the prosecution’s case. Their indictment accused Lula of receiving a beachfront triplex apartment from the construction firm Grupo OAS as a bribe in exchange for facilitating millions of dollars in contracts with Petrobras, but they lacked solid documentary evidence to prove that the apartment was Lula’s or that he ever facilitated any contracts. Without the apartment, there was no case, and without the Petrobras link, the case would fall out of their jurisdiction and into that of the São Paulo division of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office, which had argued that it, rather than Operation Car Wash prosecutors, had jurisdiction over the case against Lula.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They will say that we are accusing based on newspaper articles and fragile evidence &#8230; so it&#8217;d be good if this item is wrapped up tight. Apart from this item, so far I am apprehensive about the connection between Petrobras and enrichment, and after they told me I am apprehensive about the apartment story,&#8221; wrote Dallagnol in a group Telegram chat with his colleagues on September 9, 2016, four days before filing their indictment against Lula. &#8220;These are points in which we have to have solid answers and on the tips of our tongues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>None of Dallagnol&#8217;s subordinates responded to his messages in the materials examined for this article.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors in São Paulo had <a href="https://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/politica/2016/03/16/interna_politica,743959/promotores-de-sp-que-querem-lula-na-cadeia-recorrem-contra-decisao-de.shtml">publicly questioned</a> the Petrobras connection in an official court filing, noting, &#8220;In 2009-2010 there was no talk of scandal at Petrobras. In 2005, when the presidential couple, in theory, began to pay installments on the property, there was no indication of an &#8216;oil scandal&#8217;.”</p>\n<p>The Curitiba-based Car Wash team eventually prevailed over their São Paulo counterparts and were able to maintain the high-profile, politically explosive case in their jurisdiction. But private chats reveal that their argument was a bluff — they weren&#8217;t actually sure of the Petrobras link that was the key to maintaining their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night at 10:45 p.m., a day after expressing his original doubts, Dallagnol messaged the group again: &#8220;I&#8217;m so horny for this O GLOBO article from 2010. I&#8217;m going to kiss whichever one of you found this.&#8221; The <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/caso-bancoop-triplex-do-casal-lula-esta-atrasado-3041591">article</a>, headlined &#8220;Bancoop Case: Lula Couple&#8217;s Triplex Is Delayed,&#8221; was the first to publicly mention Lula owning an apartment in Guarujá, a coastal town in São Paulo state. The 645-word article, published years before the Car Wash investigation began, does not mention OAS or Petrobras and instead covers the bankruptcy of the construction cooperative behind the development and how it could negatively impact the delivery date of Lula&#8217;s new vacation apartment.</p>\n<p>The article was submitted as evidence and, in his decision to convict Lula, Moro wrote that the O Globo article &#8220;is quite relevant from a probative point of view.&#8221; But Lula’s defense attorneys dispute that he was the owner of a triplex, claiming instead that he purchased a smaller, single level apartment on a lower floor, and the O Globo article presented no documentation proving otherwise.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is a small but telling inconsistency between the O Globo article and the claims of the prosecution regarding the triplex. The article itself puts Lula’s penthouse in Tower B, and even notes that Tower A is yet to be built at the time the article was written: “The second tower, if constructed according to the project blueprints, finalized in the early 2000s, may end part of Lula’s joy: the building will be in front of the president&#8217;s property, obstructing his ocean view at Guarujá.” But the prosecutors alleged that Lula owned the beachfront triplex in Tower A. Without noting this contradiction, Item 191 of the indictment cites the O Globo article: “This article explained that the then President LULA and [his wife] MARISA LETÍCIA would receive a triplex penthouse, with a view to the sea, in the said venture.&#8221; That is the apartment that would eventually be seized by authorities and that Lula would be convicted of receiving.</p>\n<p>Car Wash prosecutors used the article as evidence that the triplex belonged to the presidential family, but indicted and convicted Lula on a triplex in a different building — demonstrating that the investigation was imprecise on the central point of their case: identifying the bribe that Lula allegedly received from the contractor.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>When the indictment was revealed during a press conference on September 14, the triplex and its provenance as a bribe from OAS were the key pieces of evidence on the charges of passive corruption and money laundering. In a now infamous moment, Dallagnol presented a typo-laden PowerPoint presentation that showed &#8220;Lula&#8221; written in a blue bubble surrounded by 14 other bubbles containing everything from “Lula’s reaction” and “expressiveness” to “illicit enrichment” and “bribeocracy.” All arrows pointed back to Lula, whom they characterized as the mastermind behind a sprawling criminal enterprise. The presentation was widely spoofed and criticized by critics as evidence of the weakness of the Car Wash prosecutors&#8217; case.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="pt" dir="ltr">O PowerPoint de Deltan Dallagnol foi corroborado no TRF-4. <a href="https://t.co/qFCU9UbWe5">https://t.co/qFCU9UbWe5</a> <a href="https://t.co/2Kd7LQKBpY">pic.twitter.com/2Kd7LQKBpY</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; O Antagonista (@o_antagonista) <a href="https://twitter.com/o_antagonista/status/956167537347067904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>Two days later, Dallagnol messaged Moro and, in private, explained that they went to great lengths to characterize Lula as the &#8220;maximum leader&#8221; of the corruption scheme as a way to link the politician to the R$87 million (US$26.7 million, at the time) paid in bribes by OAS for contracts at two Petrobras refineries — a charge without material evidence, he admitted, but one that was essential so that the case could be tried under Moro&#8217;s jurisdiction in Curitiba.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The indictment is based on a lot of indirect evidence of authorship, but it wouldn’t fit to say that in the indictment and in our communications we avoided that point,&#8221; Dallagnol wrote. &#8220;It was not understood that the long exposition on command of the scheme was necessary to impute corruption to the former president. A lot of people did not understand why we put him as the leader to gain 3,7MM in money laundering, when it was not for that, but to impute 87MM of corruption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moro responded two days later: “Definitely, the criticisms of your presentation are disproportionate. Stand firm.&#8221; Less than a year later, the judge sentenced the former president to nine years and six months in prison. The ruling was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/24/lula-brazil-corruption-conviction-car-wash/">quickly upheld</a> unanimously by an appeals court and the sentence was extended to 12 years and one month. In an interview, the president of the appeals court <a href="https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/politica/noticia/2017/08/apos-elogiar-sentenca-de-moro-presidente-do-trf4-afirma-que-lula-tera-julgamento-justo-e-imparcial-9863616.html">characterized</a> Moro’s decision as “just and impartial” before later admitting that he had not yet obtained access to the underlying evidence in the case. One of the three judges on the panel was an <a href="http://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/eles-vao-julgar-lula/">old friend and classmate</a> of Moro’s.</p>\n<p>Even Lula’s most vehement critics, including those who believe him to be corrupt, have expressed doubts about the strength of this particular conviction. Many have argued that it was chosen as the first case because it was simple enough to process quickly, in time to fulfill the real goal: to bar Lula from being re-elected.</p>\n<p>Until now, most of the evidence necessary to evaluate the motives and internal beliefs of the Car Wash task force and Moro remained secret. Reporting on this archive now finally enables the public — in Brazil and internationally — to evaluate both the validity of Lula’s conviction and the propriety of those who worked so tirelessly to bring it about.</p>\n<p>The Intercept contacted the offices of the Car Wash task force and Sergio Moro immediately upon publication and will update the stories with their comments if and when they provide them. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-archive-operation-car-wash">Read the editors&#8217; statement here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 9, 2019, 8:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Car Wash task force did not refute the authenticity of the information published by The Intercept.

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>An enormous trove</u> of secret documents reveals that Brazil’s most powerful prosecutors, who have spent years insisting they are apolitical, instead plotted to prevent the Workers&#8217; Party, or PT, from winning the 2018 presidential election by blocking or weakening a pre-election interview with former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva with the explicit purpose of affecting the outcome of the election.</p>\n<p>The massive archive, provided exclusively to The Intercept, shows multiple examples of politicized abuse of prosecutorial powers by those who led the country&#8217;s sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption probe since 2014. It also reveals a long-denied political and ideological agenda. One glaring example occurred 10 days before the first round of presidential voting last year, when a Supreme Court justice granted a petition from the country’s largest newspaper, Folha de São Paulo, to interview Lula, who was in prison on corruption charges brought by the Car Wash task force.</p>\n<p>Immediately upon learning of that decision on September 28, 2018, the team of prosecutors who handled Lula’s corruption case — who spent years vehemently denying that they were driven by political motives of any kind — began discussing in a private Telegram chat group how to block, subvert, or undermine the Supreme Court decision. This was based on their expressed fear that the decision would help the PT — Lula’s party — win the election. Based on their stated desire to prevent the PT&#8217;s return to power, they spent hours debating strategies to prevent or dilute the political impact of Lula’s interview.</p>\n<p>The Car Wash prosecutors explicitly said that their motive in stopping Lula’s interview was to prevent the PT from winning. One of the prosecutors, Laura Tessler, exclaimed upon learning of the decision, “What a joke!” and then explained the urgency of preventing or undermining the decision. “A press conference before the second round of voting could help elect Haddad,” she wrote in the chat group, referring to the PT&#8217;s candidate Fernando Haddad. The chief of the prosecutor task force, Deltan Dallagnol, conducted a separate conversation with a longtime confidant, also a prosecutor, and they agreed that they would “pray” together that the events of that day would not usher in the PT’s return to power.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="secret-brazil-archive" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>Many in Brazil have long accused the Car Wash prosecutors, as well as the judge who adjudicated the corruption cases, Sérgio Moro (now the country’s justice minister under President Jair Bolsonaro), of being driven by ideological and political motives. Moro and the Car Wash team have repeatedly denied these accusations, insisting that their only consideration was to expose and punish political corruption irrespective of party or political faction.</p>\n<p>But this new archive of documents — some of which are being published today in other articles by The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil — casts considerable doubt on the denials of the prosecutors. Indeed, many of these documents show <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">improper and unethical plotting between Dallagnol and Moro</a> on how to best structure the corruption case against Lula — although Moro was legally required to judge the case as a neutral arbiter. Other documents include <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">private admissions among the prosecutors</a> that the evidence proving Lula’s guilt was lacking. Overall, the documents depict a task force of prosecutors seemingly intent on exploiting its legal powers for blatantly political ends, led by its goal of preventing a return to power of the Workers&#8217; Party generally, and Lula specifically.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253988" src="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-1093835456-sergio-moro-1560054130.jpg" alt="Sergio Moro, Brazil\'s minister of Justice, speaks during a news conference in Brasilia, Brazil, on Monday, Feb. 4, 2019.

But this new archive of documents shines substantial light on previously unreported motives, actions, and often deceitful maneuvering by these powerful actors.</p>\n<p>While the Car Wash team of prosecutors has imprisoned a wide range of powerful politicians and billionaires, by far their most significant accomplishment was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/world/americas/brazil-lula-surrenders-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-.html">the 2018 imprisonment of Lula</a>. At the time of Lula’s conviction, all polls showed that the former president — who had twice been elected by large margins, in 2002 and then again in 2006, and left office with a 87 percent approval rate — was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/16/lula-da-silva-is-in-jail-and-hes-still-brazils-leading-candidate-for-president-here-are-3-ways-that-could-turn-out/?utm_term=.b565bbe7a708">the overwhelming frontrunner</a> to once again win the presidency in 2018.</p>\n<p>But Lula’s criminal conviction last year, once it was quickly affirmed by an appellate court, <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/09/high-court-bars-lula-candidacy.shtml">rendered him ineligible to run for the presidency</a>, clearing the way for Bolsonaro, the far-right candidate, to win against Lula’s chosen successor, Haddad, the former São Paulo mayor. Supporters of the PT and many others in Brazil have long insisted that these prosecutors, while masquerading as apolitical and non-ideological actors whose only agenda was fighting corruption, were in fact right-wing ideologues whose overriding mission was to destroy the PT and prevent Lula&#8217;s return to power in the 2018 election.</p>\n<p>These documents lend obvious credibility to those accusations. They show extensive plotting in secret to block and undermine the September 28 judicial order from Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski, which authorized one of the country’s most prominent reporters, Folha&#8217;s Mônica Bergamo, to interview Lula in prison. Lewandowski’s decision was expressly grounded in the right of a free press, which he said entitled the newspaper to speak to Lula and report on his perspectives.</p>\n<p>In his decision, Lewandowski also explained that the arguments that had been used all year to prevent a prison interview with Lula — namely, “security fears“ and the need to keep prisoners silent — were blatantly invalid given the numerous other prison interviews “permitted for prisoners condemned of crimes such as trafficking, murder and international organized crime.” The ruling also noted that Lula was neither in a maximum-security prison nor under a specially restrictive prison regime, further eroding the rationale for a ban on interviewing him.</p>\n<p>Up until that point, Lula — widely regarded as one of the most effective and charismatic political communicators in the democratic world — had been held incommunicado, prevented from speaking to the public about the election. Any pre-election interview of Lula, in which he could have offered his views on Bolsonaro and the other candidates, including the PT’s Haddad, would have commanded massive media attention and likely influenced a decisive bloc of voters who, to this day, remain highly loyal to the former president (which is why Lula, even once he was imprisoned, remained the poll frontrunner).</p>\n<p>The Car Wash prosecutors learned of the judicial decision authorizing Folha’s pre-election prison interview with Lula when an article about it was posted in their encrypted Telegram chat group. The panic among them was immediate. They repeatedly worried that the interview, to be conducted so close to the first round of voting, would help the PT’s Haddad win the presidential election. Based explicitly on that fear, the Car Wash prosecutors spent the day working feverishly to develop strategies to either overturn the ruling, delay Lula’s interview until after the election, or ensure that it was structured so as to minimize its political impact and its ability to help the PT win.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the decision, Tessler, one of the prosecutors, exclaimed: “What a joke!!! Revolting!!! There he goes hold a rally in prison. A true circus. After Mônica Bergamo, based on the principle of equal treatment, I’m sure many other journalists will also be coming … and we’re left here, made to act like clowns with a supreme court like that …” Another prosecutor, Athayde Ribeiro Costa, responded to the decision with one word and numerous exclamation marks: “Mafiosos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>\n<p>The prosecutors, according to the time stamps on their chats, spent nearly a full day inventing strategies for how to prevent the Lula interview from taking place before the election or at least dilute its impact — from speculating whether a press conference would be less effective than a one-on-one interview, or whether they should petition to allow all other prisoners to be interviewed to distract attention from Lula. Tessler then made clear why these prosecutors were so deeply upset that the public could be allowed to hear from the former president so soon before the election: “Who knows … but an interview before the second round of voting could help elect Haddad.”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-253991" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-632785312-1560054341.jpg" alt="Brazilian Deltan Dallagnol, attorney of the Federal Public Ministry, speaks during an interview in Curitiba, Brazil on January 26, 2017.

To the contrary, the entire discussion, held over many hours, reads far less like a meeting of neutral prosecutors than a war-room session of anti-PT political operatives and strategists, focused on the goal of determining the most effective way to prevent or minimize the political impact of Lula’s interview.</p>\n<p>Athayde Ribeiro Costa, for instance, cynically suggested that the omission of any date in Lewandowski’s decision could allow the Federal Police to purposely schedule the interview for after the election while pretending to comply with the order: “There’s no date. So the Federal Police could just schedule this for after the election, and we’ll still be in compliance with the decision.”</p>\n<p>Another prosecutor, Januário Paludo, proposed a series of actions designed to prevent or minimize the Lula interview: “Plan A: we could enter an appeal on the Supreme Court itself, zero probability [of success]. Plan B: open it up for everybody to interview him on the same day. It’ll be chaotic but reduces the likelihood that the interview is directed.”</p>\n<p>At no point did Dallagnol, who actively participated in the discussion throughout the day, or any other Car Wash prosecutor, suggest that it was improper for such political considerations to drive prosecutorial strategizing. Indeed, this Telegram chat group, which was used by its participants for many months, suggests that political considerations of this kind were routinely incorporated into the task force’s decision-making process.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The prosecutors lamented among themselves that they were barred from appealing the decision because an appeal in the name of the task force would make them look too political and would create the public perception that their intentions were to silence Lula and prevent him from helping the PT win — which, as these documents reveal, was indeed their actual motive. But later in the day, they learned that a right-wing party, called Novo (meaning “New”), had appealed the decision, and that the authorization to interview Lula was stayed by the court. They boisterously celebrated this news by, among other things, mocking the conflicts that were likely to arise within the Supreme Court (STF) and heaping praise on those responsible for trying to stop the interview:</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="section" data-background-color="#f6f6f6" data-nested-content="%3Cbr%20%2F%3E%0A%3Cdiv%20class%3D%27img-wrap%20align-center%20%20width-fixed%27%20style%3D%27width%3A%20px%3B%27%3E%0A%3Cimg%20class%3D%22alignright%20size-thumbnail%20wp-image-253917%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2Fwp-uploads%2Fsites%2F1%2F2019%2F06%2Fst7-1560024676.png%22%20alt%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EJanu%C3%A1rio%20Paludo%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A41%3A02%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20Just%20heard%20about%20it%E2%80%A6%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EDeltan%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A41%3A32%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20lol%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EAthayde%20Costa%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A42%3A02%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20The%20atmosphere%20at%20the%20STF%20must%20be%20great%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Ch6%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20%23000000%22%3E%3Cb%3EJanu%C3%A1rio%20Paludo%20%E2%80%93%2023%3A42%3A11%3C%2Fb%3E%20%E2%80%93%3C%2Fspan%3E%20it%E2%80%99s%20gonna%20be%20a%20war%20of%20judicial%20decisions%E2%80%A6%3C%2Fh6%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cdiv%20class%3D%27img-wrap%20align-center%20%20width-fixed%27%20style%3D%27width%3A%20px%3B%27%3E%0A%3Cimg%20class%3D%22alignright%20size-thumbnail%20wp-image-253919%22%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2Fwp-uploads%2Fsites%2F1%2F2019%2F06%2Fst8-1560024775.png%22%20alt%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3Cbr%20%2F%3E%0A"></div>\n<p>Paludo added, ironically, that &#8220;we should thank our Prosecutors&#8217; Office: the Novo Party!&#8221; meaning that this right-wing political party, which was also contesting the 2018 election, had performed what the task force themselves wanted to achieve by preventing Lula from being heard.</p>\n<p>The appeal from that party resulted in a judicial stay of Lewandowski&#8217;s interview authorization. As a result, no pre-election interview with Lula was permitted and he was thus never heard from prior to the voting. Only once the election was concluded and Bolsonaro won did the Supreme Court begin authorizing media outlets to interview Lula in prison. Last month, Bergamo of Folha was permitted to interview Lula <a href="https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/04/27/politica/1556391281_348638.html">jointly with El País Brasil</a>, and shortly thereafter, Lewandowski granted The Intercept Brasil’s petition to interview Lula alone, the video and transcript of which <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/22/lula-brazil-ex-president-prison-interview/">were published by The Intercept</a>.</p>\n<p>Once Bolsonaro was elected president, he quickly offered Moro — whose corruption ruling had resulted in Lula’s candidacy being barred — a newly created and unprecedentedly powerful position as what is now called the “super justice minister,” designed to reflect the massive powers vested in Moro.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\' style=\'width: 1024px;\'> <a href="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/appoints-1560085005.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254067" src="https://prod01-cdn04.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/appoints-1560085005-1024x567.png" alt="appoints-1560085005" /></a> </div>\n<p>That the same judge who found Lula guilty was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-sergio-moro-brazil-justice-ministry-anti-corruption">rewarded by Lula’s victorious opponent</a> made even longtime supporters of the Car Wash corruption probe uncomfortable, due to the obvious perception (real or not) of a quid pro quo, and by the transformation of Moro, who long insisted he was apolitical, into a political official working for the most far-right president ever elected in the history of Brazil’s democracy. Those concerns heightened when Bolsonaro <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2019/05/bolsonaro-says-he-will-nominate-sergio-moro-to-the-supreme-court.shtml">recently admitted</a> that he had also promised to appoint Moro to a lifelong seat on the Supreme Court as soon as there was a vacancy.</p>\n<p>Now that the actual conversations and actions of the Car Wash team and of Moro can be revealed and seen, the public — both in Brazil and internationally — will finally have the opportunity to evaluate whether their longtime denials of being politically motivated were ever true.</p>\n<p>These September 28 discussions are just the start of reporting by The Intercept and The Intercept Brasil on this archive.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 9, 2019, 8:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Car Wash task force did not refute the authenticity of the information published by The Intercept.

That sweeping scandal implicated numerous leading political figures, oligarchs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/americas/brazil-car-wash-corruption-temer.html">Bolsonaro&#8217;s predecessor as president</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-17/former-president-of-peru-shoots-self-in-head-as-police-close-in">even foreign leaders</a> in corruption prosecutions.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, Car Wash was the investigative saga that led to the imprisonment of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva last year. Lula&#8217;s conviction by Moro, once it was quickly affirmed by an appellate court, <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/09/high-court-bars-lula-candidacy.shtml">rendered him ineligible to run for president</a> at a time when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/16/lula-da-silva-is-in-jail-and-hes-still-brazils-leading-candidate-for-president-here-are-3-ways-that-could-turn-out/?utm_term=.b565bbe7a708">all polls showed that Lula</a> — who was twice elected president by large margins in 2002 and in 2006 before being term-limited out of office in 2010 with <a href="http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2010/12/popularidade-de-lula-bate-recorde-e-chega-87-diz-ibope.html">an 87 percent approval rating</a> — was the frontrunner in the 2018 presidential race. Lula&#8217;s exclusion from the election, based on Moro&#8217;s finding of guilt, was a key episode that paved the way for Bolsonaro&#8217;s election victory.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most remarkably, after Bolsonaro won the presidency, he created a new position of unprecedented authority, referred to by Brazilians as &#8220;super justice minister,&#8221; to oversee an agency with consolidated powers over law enforcement, surveillance, and investigation previously interspersed among multiple ministries. Bolsonaro created that position for the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/11/bolsonaro-will-offer-superministry-to-operation-carwash-judge.shtml">benefit of the very judge who found Lula guilty</a>, Sergio Moro, and it is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46063656">the position Moro now occupies</a>. In other words, Moro now wields immense police and surveillance powers in Brazil — courtesy of a president who was elected only after Moro, while he was a judge, rendered Bolsonaro&#8217;s key adversary ineligible to run against him.</p>\n<p>The Car Wash prosecutors and Moro have been highly controversial in Brazil and internationally — heralded by many as anti-corruption heroes and accused by others of being clandestine right-wing ideologues masquerading as apolitical law enforcers. Their critics have insisted that they have abused and exploited their law enforcement powers with the politicized goal of preventing Lula from returning to the presidency and destroying his leftist Workers&#8217; Party, or the PT. Moro and the prosecutors have, with equal vehemence, denied that they have any political allegiances or objectives and have said they are simply trying to cleanse Brazil of corruption.</p>\n<p>But, until now, the Car Wash prosecutors and Moro have carried out their work largely in secret, preventing the public from evaluating the validity of the accusations against them and the truth of their denials. That&#8217;s what makes this new archive so journalistically valuable: For the first time, the public will learn what these judges and prosecutors were saying and doing when they thought nobody was listening.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s articles show, among other things, that the Car Wash prosecutors spoke openly of their desire to prevent the PT from winning the election and took steps to carry out that agenda, and that Moro secretly and unethically collaborated with the Car Wash prosecutors to help design the case against Lula despite serious internal doubts about the evidence supporting the accusations, only for him to then pretend to be its neutral adjudicator.</p>\n<p>The Intercept’s only role in obtaining these materials was to receive them from our source, who contacted us many weeks ago (long before the <a href="https://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/brazil/brazils-justice-ministers-smartphone-hacked-for-six-hours/">recently alleged hacking of Moro&#8217;s telephone</a>) and informed us that they had already obtained the full set of materials and was eager to provide them to journalists.</p>\n<p>Informing the public of matters in the public interest and exposing wrongdoing was our guiding principle in doing this initial reporting on the archive, and it will continue to be our guiding principle as we report further on the large number of materials we have been provided.</p>\n<p>The sheer volume of materials in this archive, as well as the fact that many documents include private conversations among public officials, requires us to make journalistic decisions about which documents should be reported on and published, and which documents should be withheld.</p>\n<p>When making these judgments, we employ the standard used by journalists in democracies around the world: namely, that material revealing wrongdoing or deceit by powerful actors should be reported, but information that is purely private in nature and whose disclosure may infringe upon legitimate privacy interests or other social values should be withheld.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in our reporting on this material, we are guided by the same rationale that led much of Brazilian society — including many journalists, commentators, and activists — to praise the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/release-tapped-phone-calls-lula-rousseff-deepens-brazil-chaos">disclosure in 2016 by Moro and various media outlets of the private telephone calls</a> between Lula and former President Dilma Rousseff, in which the two leaders discussed the possibility of Lula becoming a minister in Dilma’s government. Disclosure of those private calls was crucial in turning public opinion against the PT, helping to lay the groundwork for Dilma&#8217;s 2016 impeachment and Lula&#8217;s 2018 imprisonment. The principle invoked to justify that disclosure was the same one we are adhering to in our reporting on these materials: that a democracy is healthier when significant actions undertaken in secret by powerful figures are revealed to the public.</p>\n<p>But unlike those disclosures by Moro and various media outlets of the private conversations between Lula and Dilma — which included not only matters whose disclosures were in the public interest, but also private communications of Lula that <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/transcript-of-phone-calls-between-former-brazilian-president-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-and-various-political-supporters/article29285890/">had no public relevance</a> and that many argued were released with the intention of personally embarrassing Lula — The Intercept has resolved to withhold any private communications, audio recordings, videos, or other materials relating to Moro, Dallagnol, or any other parties that are purely private in nature and thus unrelated to matters of public interest.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>We have taken measures to secure the archive and all of its component materials outside of Brazil, so that numerous journalists have access to it, ensuring that no authorities in any country will have the ability to prevent reporting based on these materials. We intend to report on and publish stories based on the archive as expeditiously as possible in accordance with our high standards of factual accuracy and journalistic responsibility.</p>\n<p>Consistent with journalistic practice in countries where the press operates under the threat of censorship and prior restraint orders, as has been the situation recently in Bolsonaro-led Brazil, we did not seek comment from the powerful legal officials mentioned in these stories prior to publication because we did not want to give them advance notice of this reporting, and because the documents speak for themselves. We contacted them immediately upon publication and will update the stories with their comments if and when they provide them.</p>\n<p>Given the immense power wielded by these actors, and the secrecy under which they have — until now — been able to operate, transparency is crucial for Brazil and the international community to have a clear understanding of what they have really done. A free press exists to shine a light on what the most powerful figures in society do in the dark.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: June 9, 2019, 8:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Car Wash task force did not refute the authenticity of the information published by The Intercept. In a press release published Sunday evening, they wrote, “possibly among the illegally copied information are documents and data on ongoing strategies and investigations and on the personal and security routines of task force members and their families.

      title: 'Amid Spike in Migrants Crossing the Mediterranean, Europe Is Still Delaying Rescues',
      link: 'https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/europe-migrants-mediterranean-rescues/',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>As summer weather</u> warms the Mediterranean, the number of boats bearing migrants that are caught in distress has spiked, according to groups involved in running search and rescue operations there. Advocates say that European policies aimed at limiting the number of migrants reaching their shores are in fact making the route more deadly.</p>\n<p>More migrants than usual have been leaving Libya for southern Europe in small crafts in the last month and falling into danger along the way, according to Haidi Sadik of Sea-Watch, a nonprofit that does search and rescue.</p>\n<p>“Our civil reconnaissance aircraft called Moonbird has been flying missions throughout the year, including in May, and has seen a significant increase in the number of boats in distress from the air,” said Sadik.</p>\n<p>“We’ve definitely also seen an increase over the last few weeks,” said Maurice Stierl, who helped found Alarm Phone, an activist collective that runs an emergency hotline for migrants in distress in the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href="https://missingmigrants.iom.int/region/mediterranean?migrant_route%5B%5D=1376&amp;migrant_route%5B%5D=1377&amp;migrant_route%5B%5D=1378">Missing Migrants Project</a>, at least 107 migrants died this May crossing the Mediterranean, up from 60 in April. And though far fewer migrants overall compared to this time last year are making the trip, a greater portion of those who do attempt the crossing are dying.</p>\n<p>In the first six months of 2018, 791 of the 70,531 people who attempted the Mediterranean crossing to Europe — 1.1 percent — died. Since January of this year, 35,122 people have attempted the crossing, and 543 have died — 1.5 percent overall, per the Missing Migrants Project.</p>\n<p>Another factor in the sudden uptick in crossing attempts is the recent increase of violence in Libya, the country through which thousands of migrants fleeing violence and poverty have passed on their way to Europe. Last month, Amnesty International voiced concerns that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/16/libya-conflict-migrants-refugees/">the lives of hundreds</a> of migrants and refugees in detention centers in Libya were under imminent threat as fighting between armed militias in the area drew closer.</p>\n<p>But Sam Turner, Médecins Sans Frontières’ head of mission for Libya, says the increased death rate in the Mediterranean is of particular note. “That’s a really key point in terms of challenging the narrative that the actions taken to prevent people from crossing the central Mediterranean … [are] leading to fewer deaths,” he told The Intercept. About 1 in 13 migrants making the crossing in the central Mediterranean region in the first five months of this year died, says Turner; last year for the same period, the number was 1 in 58.</p>\n<p><u>Meanwhile, according to</u> data compiled by Matteo Villa, a researcher at the think tank Italian Institute for International Political Studies, the number of migrants returned to Libya by the Libyan coast guard or others increased nearly tenfold from April to May, with an estimated 1,224 migrants being returned to the war-torn country in May, compared to 130 the month before. This is the greatest number of people returned to Libya since July 2018.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/03/icc-submission-calls-for-prosecution-of-eu-over-migrant-deaths">On Monday</a>, two human rights lawyers filed a 244-page complaint with the International Criminal Court, or ICC, accusing European Union governments of knowingly sending thousands of migrants to their deaths in implementing their deterrence-based migration policies.</p>\n<p>Omer Shatz, one of the lawyers who co-authored the request for the case to be taken on by the ICC, said that there used to be four major actors in the Mediterranean dealing with migrants crossing in boats: European governments, NGOs, commercial vessels, and the Libyan coast guard.</p>\n<p>Commercial vessels, which once rescued migrants from the water, now avoid doing so to evade being implicated in an increasingly politicized act. “You can guarantee that you will end up in a political standoff without somewhere to disembark these people despite the fact that you have simply engaged in a humanitarian act,” said Turner.</p>\n<p>NGOs, according to the ICC complaint, became critical actors in the Mediterranean after the EU’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/04/01/europe-keeps-its-rescue-ships-far-from-the-coast-of-libya-where-thousands-of-refugees-have-drowned/">2014 decision</a> to decrease its search and rescue operations. Yet “EU and Italian actors launched a broad political persecution against rescue NGOs, which includes intimidation, defamation, harassment, and formal criminalization,” the complaint reads. As The Intercept has reported, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/20/mediterranean-refugee-rescue-boat-italy-libya/">rescue ships</a> have been seized and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/09/16/migrant-rescue-mediterranean-sea/">volunteers arrested</a>.</p>\n<p>With the support of the EU, last year Libya established a search and rescue region beyond its territorial waters, expanding the bounds of where the country coordinates and executes search and rescue operations. As the EU has scaled down its involvement, the principal actor on these waters has become the Libyan coast guard, said Shatz.</p>\n<p>The Libyan coast guard does save lives every day, says Turner, but they can’t keep up with the number of attempted crossings, and the people they do save are sent back to dangerous and deadly conditions. (Libyan coast guard officers have also been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/25/libya-coast-guard-europe-refugees/">accused of abuse</a> themselves.) “Any rescue conducted by the Libyan coast guard results in a de facto forced return; the same place they were fleeing is the place they’re taken back to,” says Turner.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>According to an <a href="https://alarmphone.org/en/2019/05/21/the-mediterranean-border-mass-abductions-push-backs-people-left-to-die">Alarm Phone report</a> published May 21, European authorities have refrained from assisting certain groups of migrants in distress in an apparent attempt to defer search and rescue responsibility to the Libyan coast guard. “Over the last two months … we had to witness several severe human rights violations at sea, including forms of push-back, refoulement, and non-assistance,” the report reads.</p>\n<p>Alarm Phone’s Stierl added that migrants seem to be changing their tactics of survival in response to the policies. “They only call when they’ve gotten further into European search and rescue zones,” he said.</p>\n<p>Alarm Phone shared an edited portion of a recent entry in its logbook with The Intercept that detailed one such event. On May 29, according to the book, the hotline made contact via satellite phone with a boat carrying about 100 people.</p>\n<p>The Alarm Phone entry for 1:20 a.m. on May 30 reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Talked with the boat again – again we cannot promise when coastguards are coming. He says: “It is so fucking inhumane what they are doing with us. We are here in the sea for more than a day now. They came with airplanes helicopters and everything. They know where we are and they just wait for the Libyans to come tomorrow to pick our corpses. Those who will still be alive will maybe then also go into the water because they want rather to die than to go back to Libya. Why can&#8217;t they let any fisher boat save us and then at least to avoid people to die. They can bring us to whatever shitty prison. But this situation here is so inhumane, you cannot imagine how we suffer.” We tell him that we will stay with them until the end, whatever happens. We promise that we call the coastguards and inform the public to raise pressure. He thanks us for being with them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The group, according to Alarm Phone, were ultimately <a href="https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1134003235335880705">rescued by the Italian navy</a>, which means that they became among the few these days to head for an Italian port. But the rescue took too long, Alarm Phone maintains.</p>\n<p>“The @ItalianNavy vessel P490 had monitored the boat in distress yesterday already &amp; could have rescued them nearly a day ago. This act of #non-assistance risked the lives of 90 people,” <a href="https://twitter.com/alarm_phone/status/1134008227887288325">wrote</a> Alarm Phone on Twitter.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/europe-migrants-mediterranean-rescues/">Amid Spike in Migrants Crossing the Mediterranean, Europe Is Still Delaying Rescues</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

The #FAMa and #Barkhane are conducting a joint operation in the locality of Akabar, in the Ménaka sector. This operation made it possible to neutralize about twenty terrorists,” the Malian army reported on Twitter, without further details.\n\n A jihadist group that calls itself the “Islamic State in the Great Sahara” (EIGS) is mainly active in this region of Ménaka and across the border with Niger.\n\n In particular, he claimed responsibility for the October 2017 attack on Tongo Tongo in Niger. This ambush cost the lives of four American and four Nigerian soldiers.\n\n Northern Mali had fallen in March-April 2012 under the control of jihadist groups, largely dispersed by a military intervention launched in January 2013 at the initiative of France. This intervention continues with Operation Barkhane, which mobilizes some 4,500 soldiers in the Sahel.\n\n But entire areas of Mali are beyond the control of Malian, French and UN forces, despite the signing in 2015 of a peace agreement intended to definitively isolate jihadists.\n\n Since 2015, violence has spread from the North to the centre, and sometimes even to the South. They are very often involved in inter-community conflicts, a phenomenon that also affects neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\n The Dogon village of Sobane Da, near Bandiagara (central Mali), was the scene of an attack on the evening of 9 June that killed 35 people, including 24 children.\n\n Violence in the centre of the country culminated in the massacre on 23 March, attributed to Dogon hunters of some 160 Fulani, in the village of Ogossagou, near the border with Burkina Faso.',

The authorities reported 61 deaths.\n\n The repression took place after the suspension of negotiations between military leaders and protest leaders. The Military Council expressed regret that “errors have occurred”.\n\n “An independent international inquiry should be launched” into the dispersal of the sit-in, Sadek al-Mahdi told AFP after conducting Friday prayers in a mosque in Omdurman, a nearby city in Khartoum.  \n\n “It is important that the investigation be impartial and not show bias in favour of the authorities,” added Mahdi, former head of government, who was overthrown by Bashir in a coup d‘état in 1989.\n\n Mr. Mahdi’s al-Oumma party is part of the Alliance for Freedom and Change (ALC), a group of leading protest groups that are calling for a transfer of power to civilians.\n\n The military leaders themselves refused such an investigation. “We do not accept (the idea of) an international commission of inquiry. We are a sovereign state,” General Chamseddine Kabbachi, spokesman for the Military Council, told journalists on Thursday.\n\n While regretting the incidents of June 3, Mr. Kabbachi assured that the plan was only to clear an area near the sit-in but that “excesses” had occurred.\n\n He said the military is conducting its own investigation, the results of which are due to be released on Saturday.\n\n *Disappointment\n\n Faithful people present in the mosque visited by Mr. Mahdi on Friday expressed their frustration with the generals.\n\n “The way the sit-in was dispersed was brutal and unacceptable,” said Salim Gebril, a university professor and member of the al-Ummma party.\n\n The ruling generals “continue to say that they hope to reach an agreement (with the leaders of the protest) but their tone seems to indicate that they could take a different path,” he said.\n\n Abdelrahmane Amir al-Tom, another devotee, found the Military Council’s reaction “extremely disappointing”.\n\n The protest leaders and military leaders agreed to resume talks after mediation by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.\n\n Mr. Mahdi believes that this mediation “can have a positive impact”. “In the long run, the Military Council cannot govern, it is clear, and civilian forces cannot speak of a future that excludes the participation of the Military Council,” he said.',

      content: 'Burkinabe scientists in one of the country’s village plagued by malarial mosquitoes, are conducting an experiment to test whether a fungus genetically-engineered to produce a toxin found in spider venom can provide a breakthrough in the worldwide fight against malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne disease that killed an estimated 435,000 people in 2017, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n “If we can find a solution against this disease which killed my child, other people we will thank god. They should do everything to eradicate this disease,” said Dramane Ouedraogo, a dedicated father that has visited his son’s grave every day since the two-year-old died of malaria, n the village of Soumousso.\n\n Brian Lovett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Maryland leading the project said the idea is to target the mosquitoes using the natural characteristics of the fungus and spider venom.\n\n The scientists have engineered the DNA of the Metarhizium pingshaense fungus to deliver a toxin produced by Australian Blue Mountains funnel-web spiders. The toxin kills the malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito when the fungus comes in contact with insect blood.\n\n “Out of the box, if they land anywhere on the outside of a mosquito, they’ll recognize that they’re on a mosquito and they’ll burrow their way into the mosquito,” Lovett,the lead author on the study said.\n\n  Finding sustainable solutions\n\n Raymond St. Leger, the University of Maryland professor who co-authored the study, said the idea came after the World Health Organization issued a call for a scientific solution to the rapid evolution of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes that had adapted to survive conventional insecticides.\n\n “We took a gene from a spider and we put that spider gene which encodes an insect-selective toxin, we put that gene into the fungus, under the control of a promoter— and the promoter is the on-off switch of a gene— under the control of this promoter which only turns on in insect blood,” he said.\n\n After successful lab trials, the U.S.-based team headed to Burkina Faso, where scientists there produced and tested the toxin-infused fungus in a national research lab in Bobo Dioulasso and constructed a simulated village named “Mosquito-Sphere” in nearby Soumousso, complete with huts and muddy pools.\n\n Insecticide-resistant mosquitoes multiplied in a large enclosed breeding site and calves were used as bait to lure the mosquitoes into experimental houses where a black cloth saturated with the fungus was hung from the wall.\n\n “The mosquitoes fly around the room, looking for bait to feed, so they feed on the (calf). After feeding, mosquitoes look for a place to rest, they usually go on the wall. Given they are attracted to black, they will rest on the treated cloth which is black. That is when they make contact with the fungus spores and the fungus starts to germinate inside them and that is what kills them,” Abdoulaye Diabate, head of the research team at the Institut de Recherche en Science de la Santé in Burkina Faso, explained.\n\n  Hopeful results\n\n Researchers reported dramatic results.\n\n “Within two generations, we’ve killed 99 percent of the mosquitoes. So it caused the mosquito population to collapse,” St. Leger said, adding that this type of mosquito produces two generations in about 45 days.\n\n Baladji Ouattara, village chief of Soumousso, said the research has given hope to a community where malaria has been a fact of life.\n\n “Malaria is the disease that affects villagers the most. We know that the mosquitoes that cause it will never be completely killed. But if this project being developed here is a good solution, I would ask the agents to extend their project to all the houses in the village.”\n\n By employing the fungus in tandem with conventional insecticides, the scientists believe they can prevent mosquitoes from developing resistance and the same technology could one day be used to combat other mosquito-borne illnesses, such as Zika and Dengue.\n\n REUTERS',

      content: 'What next for Uganda?\n\n Ugandan authorities have now drawn up a list of 98 contacts, or contacts of contacts, potentially exposed to the Ebola virus, of whom 10 are considered “high risk”, said Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies programme. \n\n Vaccination of those contacts and health workers with a Merck experimental vaccine is to start on Saturday, he said.\n\n Ryan told Reuters on Friday that there had been no sign of local transmission of Ebola virus in Uganda.\n\n “No evidence yet…But we’re not out of the woods yet,” he said, noting that the incubation period is up to 21 days. \n\n  June 14: WHO’s position on Ebola\n\n The World Health Organization on Friday decided not to declare an international emergency over Congo’s Ebola outbreak despite its spread to Uganda this week, concluding such a declaration could cause too much economic harm.\n\n In a statement, the panel of 13 independent medical experts on the WHO’s Emergency Committee urged neighbouring “at risk” countries to improve their preparedness for detecting and managing imported cases, “as Uganda has done”. \n\n “This is not a global emergency, it is an emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a severe emergency and it may affect neighbouring counties,” Dr. Preben Aavitsland, the panel’s acting chair told a news conference at the U.N. agency’s headquarters in Geneva.\n\n “It was the view of the Committee that there is really nothing to gain by declaring a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern), but there is potentially a lot to lose.”\n\n Such a declaration would risk creating restrictions on travel or trade “that could severely harm the economy in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Aavitsland said.\n\n WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking by telephone from Kampala, said: “The spread of Ebola to Uganda is a new development but the fundamental dynamics of the outbreak haven’t changed.”\n\n Some medical groups had urged the committee to declare an emergency which would have led to boosting public health measures, funding and resources.\n\n Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University Law School, voiced disappointment that the panel had failed to declare an emergency for the third time.\n\n “The @WHO was criticized for delay in declaring a PHEIC in W Africa. Will it’s failure in DRC affect legitimacy?” Gostin tweeted. He said he admired the panel members but disagreed with their conclusion.\n\n Only four emergencies have been declared in the past decade, including the worst ever Ebola outbreak, which hit West Africa in 2014-2016. The others were an influenza pandemic in 2009, polio in 2014 and the Zika virus in 2016.\n\n REUTERS\n\n  June 13: Uganda repatriates Ebola suspects to Congo\n\n Authorities in Uganda on Thursday banned public gatherings in the Western district of Kasese, where two people have died of Ebola.\n\n Relatives of the two people who died of Ebola were also repatriated from Uganda to Democratic Republic of Congo, where they will receive experimental and therapeutic treatment.\n\n “Hand washing facilities have been put in place, with washing materials like JIK (bleach) and soap. There’s no shaking of hands, people just wave at each other,’‘ local journalist Ronald Kule told Reuters.\n\n While the repatriation means there’s no confirmed case of Ebola in Uganda as of Thursday, three other suspected Ebola cases not related to the family remain in isolation, the health ministry said.\n\n “Uganda remains in Ebola response mode to follow up the 27 contacts (of the family),” read part of a statement from the Uganda’s health ministry.\n\n Meanwhile, Red Cross teams have embarked on an Ebola awareness drive in the Uganda-DRC border area following confirmed cases of the disease. \n\n  Managing a porous border\n\n Uganda’s Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng said challenges remained at “unofficial entry points” between Congo and Uganda, which share a porous 875-kilometre (545-mile) border.\n\n These unauthorised border crossings, known as “panyas” in the local Lukonzo language, are often merely planks laid down across a point in the river, or through forests and mountains where there is no surveillance.\n\n The family that was repatriated on Thursday had crossed from Congo to Uganda earlier this week and sought treatment when a 5-year-old boy became unwell. He died of Ebola on Tuesday. His 50-year-old grandmother, who was accompanying them, died of the disease on Wednesday, the ministry said.\n\n  June 11: WHO emergency meeting scheduled for June 14 \n\n The World Health Organization announced an emergency committee would meet Friday to determine whether to upgrade its assessment of the situation to “a public health emergency of international concern”.\n\n WHO, in October and again in April, held off declaring the DRC epidemic an emergency of international concern, because the outbreak was contained to one part of DRC.\n\n For the committee to make the emergency call, it must determine that the epidemic “carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border and may require immediate international action”.\n\n If such a declaration is made Friday it will represent a major shift in mobilisation against the disease.\n\n  Experts worried\n\n The current Ebola epidemic began in August last year in eastern Congo and has already infected at least 2,062 people, killing 1,390 of them.\n\n “This epidemic is in a truly frightening phase and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon,” said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity which is involved in fighting Ebola.\n\n “We can expect and should plan for more cases in DRC and neighbouring countries,” he said, adding: “There are now more deaths than any other Ebola outbreak in history, bar the West Africa Epidemic of 2013-16, and there can be no doubt that the situation could escalate towards those terrible levels.”\n\n The Red Cross said it was scaling up efforts to contain the spread of the virus since it was detected in Uganda.\n\n “This is a worrying development, but we have been preparing for this day for months now,” Robert Kwesiga, Uganda Red Cross Secretary General, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n Experts noted that Uganda, which has been on high alert for possible spread of Ebola and has already vaccinated many frontline healthworkers, is relatively well prepared and should be able to limit the virus’ spread.\n\n “The current cases in Uganda will be quickly contained but the failure to stop the current Ebola epidemic in DRC is simply tragic,” said Ian Jones, a professor virology at Britain’s Reading University.\n\n Agencies\n\n   Brief: Uganda’s Ebola preparedness \n\n Since the epidemic began in August in eastern Congo, the Congo health ministry said on Monday that it had recorded 2,062 cases, including 1,390 deaths.\n\n Neighbouring Uganda has suffered regular outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg over the years, both high-fatality viral haemorrhagic fevers. Health facilities to treat the diseases are relatively robust.\n\n A donor-supported laboratory in Entebbe, a lakeside town south of the capital Kampala, means Uganda typically confirms outbreaks much faster than many of its neighbours.\n\n Preparing for possible cases of Ebola, Uganda has vaccinated nearly 4,700 health workers, disease monitoring has been intensified, special treatment units set up and health workers have been trained to recognize symptoms of the disease, WHO said.\n\n Uganda’s worst Ebola outbreak was in 2000 when 425 people were infected. More than half of them died.\n\n REUTERS\n\n   June 11: Ebola deaths recorded\n\n At least two people have so far died of Ebola in Uganda, following Tuesday’s confirmation that the deadly virus had crossed into the country.\n\n The five-year-old Congolese child who was the first recorded case in Uganda and its grandmother have both succumbed to the virus, at Bwere General Hospital, where an isolation facility has been established.\n\n Authorities are now worried about the spread of the epidemic, after more cases were confirmed on Wednesday.\n\n “Two more samples … have tested positive,” the World Health Organization agency said on Twitter, citing the health minister and bringing the total tally of confirmed cases to three.\n\n Local news channel, Daily Monitor, said Ebola cases in the country have risen to 10, citing the country’s health minister Dr. Ruth Aceng who said there are seven more suspects, including two men, two women and a six-months-old baby, who came from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n   June 10: Ebola confirmed in Uganda\n\n A case of Ebola has been confirmed in Uganda, ten months after the deadly virus was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 5-year-old Congolese child, who entered Uganda on June 9 through Bwera Border post, is receiving care, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.\n\n “This is the first confirmed case in Uganda during the Ebola outbreak on-going in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo,” the WHO said in a statement.\n\n The child’s family sought medical care at Kagando hospital and the child was transferred to Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit for management, the WHO said.\n\n “The confirmation was made today by the Uganda Virus Institute (UVRI) ...contacts are being monitored,” WHO said.\n\n  How the Ebola victim came to Uganda\n\n The boy was accompanied by his Ugandan father and Congolese mother, who had returned to Congo to nurse her father before he died of Ebola, Uganda’s Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told a news conference. \n\n The family returned to Uganda with four other family members of Congolese origin, Aceng said. All the other Congolese family members are in isolation at Bwera Hospital. Two of them have already developed symptoms similar to those of Ebola and samples have been removed from them, Aceng said. \n\n Results of tests are expected Wednesday. Eight more contacts are being followed up, Aceng said.\n\n Aceng said the family entered Uganda on June 10, not 9. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear and neither the WHO nor the government was reachable for clarification.',

More than half of them died.\n\n REUTERS\n\n   June 11: Ebola deaths recorded\n\n At least two people have so far died of Ebola in Uganda, following Tuesday’s confirmation that the deadly virus had crossed into the country.\n\n The five-year-old Congolese child who was the first recorded case in Uganda and its grandmother have both succumbed to the virus, at Bwere General Hospital, where an isolation facility has been established.\n\n Authorities are now worried about the spread of the epidemic, after more cases were confirmed on Wednesday.\n\n “Two more samples … have tested positive,” the World Health Organization agency said on Twitter, citing the health minister and bringing the total tally of confirmed cases to three.\n\n Local news channel, Daily Monitor, said Ebola cases in the country have risen to 10, citing the country’s health minister Dr. Ruth Aceng who said there are seven more suspects, including two men, two women and a six-months-old baby, who came from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n   June 10: Ebola confirmed in Uganda\n\n A case of Ebola has been confirmed in Uganda, ten months after the deadly virus was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 5-year-old Congolese child, who entered Uganda on June 9 through Bwera Border post, is receiving care, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.\n\n “This is the first confirmed case in Uganda during the Ebola outbreak on-going in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo,” the WHO said in a statement.\n\n The child’s family sought medical care at Kagando hospital and the child was transferred to Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit for management, the WHO said.\n\n “The confirmation was made today by the Uganda Virus Institute (UVRI) ...contacts are being monitored,” WHO said.\n\n  How the Ebola victim came to Uganda\n\n The boy was accompanied by his Ugandan father and Congolese mother, who had returned to Congo to nurse her father before he died of Ebola, Uganda’s Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told a news conference. \n\n The family returned to Uganda with four other family members of Congolese origin, Aceng said. All the other Congolese family members are in isolation at Bwera Hospital. Two of them have already developed symptoms similar to those of Ebola and samples have been removed from them, Aceng said. \n\n Results of tests are expected Wednesday. Eight more contacts are being followed up, Aceng said.\n\n Aceng said the family entered Uganda on June 10, not 9. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear and neither the WHO nor the government was reachable for clarification.',

The international community must do all it can to ensure a peaceful transition to civilian rule,” the group said in a tweet on Friday.\n\n The tweet was accompanied by a Nelson Mandela quote which read: “The real makers of history are the ordinary men and women…their participation in every decision about the future is the only guarantee of true democracy and freedom.”\n\n They also included a link to their June 7 statement titled: The Elders call on Egypt’s al-Sisi to uphold AU commitments on Sudan transition. The Elders are a group of independent global leaders working together for peace, justice and human rights. It was founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007.\n\n  We are #BlueForSudan. The military must end the violence. The international community must do all it can to ensure a peaceful transition to civilian rule.https://t.co/nJiA0mvXmv pic.twitter.com/QQ6NdnNOng— The Elders (@TheElders) June 14, 2019',

Meskel (@hawelti) June 14, 2019\n  \n\n   June 4, 2019: German envoy talks tough at special UNSC meeting on Sudan \n\n The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting to discuss events in Sudan after a deadly attack by security forces on protesters in Khartoum on Monday.\n\n One of the biggest pronouncements from the stakeout of the session was by the German envoy Ambassador Heusgen who warned against the use of force in a bid to achieve legitimacy.\n\n “Legitimacy cannot come from the barrel of a gun,” the German Mission to the UN quoted him in a tweet.\n\n Whiles expressing “deep concern over violence against protesters in #Sudan. He stresses the urgent need for a return to the negotiation table to bring about an inclusive, civilian-led transitional gov’t,” the tweet added.\n\n The June 3 attack led to the deaths of over 30 people whiles over 100 are reported to have sustained varied degrees of injuries. Protest leaders have vowed to escalate their push for civilian transition.\n\n Hours after the deadly removal of a sit-in by predominantly Rapid Special Forces, RSF, with the backing of other militia, the junta that deposed Omar Al-Bashir has scrapped previous agreements with protesters.\n\n The Abdul Fattah al-Burhan-led junta has also scheduled elections in nine months time, a time frame totally rejected by the protest leaders.\n\n The junta initially called for two-year transition. It later agreed a three-year period in what is now scrapped legislative deal with the protest leaders. \n\n Post-Bashir Sudan has proven to be a very difficult period as the country grapples with the aftershocks of a revolution that many believe is experiencing a counterrevolution engineered from outside the country by powerful players in the Gulf region – Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt.\n\n  On the situation in #Sudan: We are deeply worried about developments in #Khartoum. Violence against protesters cannot be justified and has to stop immediately. We call on parties to avoid escalation and to return to the negotiating table.— GermanForeignOffice (@GermanyDiplo) June 3, 2019\n  \n\n   June 3, 2019: Violent break up of Khartoum sit-in  \n\n Security forces stormed a protest camp in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Monday and opposition-linked medics said more than 30 people were killed in the worst violence since the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir in April.\n\n Footage shared on social media and verified by Reuters showed chaotic scenes of people fleeing through streets as sustained bursts of gunfire crackled in the air during violence that drew rapid Western and African censure.\n\n Witnesses said a sit-in next to the Defence Ministry, the focal point of anti-government protests that started in December, had been cleared. Protesters poured onto streets elsewhere in Khartoum and beyond in response, setting up barricades and roadblocks with rocks and burning tyres.\n\n A group of doctors linked to the opposition said 30 people had been “martyred” in Monday’s violence, with the toll expected to rise because not all casualties had been accounted for. The group had earlier said at least 116 people were wounded.\n\n The main protest group accused the ruling military council of perpetrating “a massacre” as it broke up the camp.\n\n The Transitional Military Council (TMC) denied that, with a spokesman, Lieutenant General Shams El Din Kabbashi, telling Reuters security forces were pursuing “unruly elements” who had fled to the protest site and caused chaos.\n\n “The Transitional Military Council regrets the way the situation unfolded, reaffirming its full commitment to the … safety of the citizens and renews its call for negotiations as soon as possible,” the council later said in a statement.\n\n Monday’s violence is likely to deal a blow to hopes for a restart to stalled talks and a negotiated settlement over who should govern in a transitional period after Bashir’s overthrow.\n\n Sudan’s public prosecutor on Monday ordered an investigation into the violence, state news agency SUNA said.\n\n   Early June 2019: Mass protest demanding transition \n\n Tens of thousands of Sudanese demonstrators converged on central Khartoum on Thursday night demanding civilian rule amid increasing tensions with the country’s military rulers who accused a protest encampment of threatening stability.\n\n The protest, which followed a two-day strike organised by demonstrators and opposition groups frustrated by a deadlock in talks on a transition to democracy, underscores the volatility of the situation in Sudan nearly two months after the military overthrew autocrat Omar al-Bashir.\n\n The head of the central Khartoum military region accused “unruly elements” of attacking a vehicle used by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and seizing it near the protest site.\n\n “The protest site has become unsafe and represents a danger to the revolution and the revolutionaries and threatens the coherence of the state and its national security,” General Bahar Ahmed al-Bahar, head of the central region in Khartoum said in a statement he read on television.\n\n REUTERS\n\n   May 23, 2019: Hemedti in Saudi, stalemate back home persists \n\n The two leaders of the Transitional Military Council, TMC, were in the news for different reasons on Thursday. Deputy head of TMC Mohamed Hamdan known as Hemedti arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit.\n\n He was met on arrival in Jeddah by Prince Khalid Faisal. Saudi has been blamed as one of the interferers in ongoings back in Sudan. They have since Bashir’s overthrow made financial support available to Sudan.\n\n Back home an opposition concession in transition talks was said to have been rejected by the TMC.\n\n A journalist closely following the talks, Yousra Elbagir said the coalition had offered the TMC leader, Abdul Fattah al Burhan the role of leader of the sovereign body that was to lead the three-year transition.\n\n But the TMC’s rejection was on the grounds that the coalition wanted a civilian Burhan to be leader – in which case he was expected to retire from the Army in order to hold the post. Neither the coalition or TMC have confirmed the report.\n\n “On negotiations, inside source tells me: “[Opposition] Coalition made a major concession: they offered to agree to Burhan being President/Head of the Presidential Council – on the condition that he retire from the Army. It was flatly rejected [by Transitional Military Council]” she sad in a tweet.\n\n  Vice Chair of the Transitional Military Council, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” arrives to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia today and met by Prince Khalid Faisal. pic.twitter.com/YDGsFIcj27— Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) May 23, 2019\n  \n\n   May 16, 2019: Roadblock removal starts, US lawmakers demand more pressure on junta \n\n The removal of roadblocks in parts of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, has started according to multiple reports.\n\n The many roadblocks that had crippled movement across Khartoum led to the suspension of civilian-led transition talks between the military junta and protest leaders.\n\n The military said it had suspended the talks for 72 hours effective Thursday morning. The protest leaders hit back at the move describing it as a surprise tactic by the military.\n\n  Nile Street is now officially open, after protesters clear barricades.\n\nFb live stream:.https://t.co/qhzEeDabTj— Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) May 17, 2019\n  \n\n Meanwhile, a group of United States Senators have reiterated a call for America to stand with the Sudanese people in their fight to achieve a democratic country.\n\n In a May 16 letter to the U.S. Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, the 92 bipartisan lawmakers said: “This is a critical moment for Sudan, one that came about because of the Sudanese people took to the streets to demand it.\n\n “It is also critical for the United States to support Sudanese citizen’s demands for real democratic change.” The protests that started since December 2018 has led to the ouster and arrest of long serving Omar al-Bashir.\n\n   May 16, 2019: Roadblock removal blocks transition talks \n\n Days after the military and protest leaders agreed on a deal to lead Sudan out of a post-Bashir political flux, there is a new headache in the form of mounted roadblocks.\n\n The Transitional Military Council, TMC, is calling for all roadblocks particularly in a designated area in the capital to be removed.\n\n The measure had been one of the effective means that protesters have used in pressing for their demands. Vehicular movement has been largely restricted due to the roadblocks.\n\n Protesters have also camped around these roadblocks as part of a sit-in around the premises of the military headquarters. Attempts to forcibly remove the roadblocks have failed despite claiming lives of some protesters and a security official.\n\n The two parties have agreed for a three-year transition period to a civilian administration. The opposition alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council. The sticking point is about who gets what number of seats on the sovereign council.\n\n   May 15, 2019: South Sudan president comments on crisis \n\n The military junta that deposed Omar al-Bashir have agreed a deal transition deal with the opposition alliance. This follows weeks of back and forth over post-Bashir Sudan.\n\n How long: The two parties have agreed for a three-year transition period to a civilian administration.\n\n Legislative make up: The Transitional Military Council (TMC) disclosed that  the alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council.\n\n  TMC & opposition joint presser now:\n\nThey have agreed on a transitional period of three years & a legislative council comprising of 300 members, 67% will be signatories of the Declaration of Freedom & Change and 33% will not.\n\nNo mention of composition of ruling council.— Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) May 14, 2019\n  \n\n Sticking point: the configuration of a sovereign council is what remains outstanding. The military and civilians have disagreed on who gets majority of seats on the council.\n\n The last time the military made concessions on the issue, they said the best they could do was to allow for equal representation.\n\n   May 14, 2019: South Sudan president comments on crisis \n\n President Salva Kiir of South Sudan has asked that the sovereignty of Sudan be respected in this time of political uncertainty as the country works towards a transition.\n\n “It is important to remind international and regional actors not to interfere in Sudan. The people of Sudan are perfectly capable of managing their own affairs. Let us prove the world wrong.\n\n “We are not war mongers, we are peace loving people and we are a proud and dignified nation,” he said on Tuesday during the opening of the second session of the South Sudan parliament in Juba. \n\n Meanwhile, over in Sudan, post-Bashir flux continues. Transition deadlock between the junta that ousted Bashir and protest leaders is reportedly making headway.\n\n The Khartoum sit-ins that have crippled movement in key areas of the capital continues. Reports indicate that in the second city Omdurman, protesters have blocked roads after deadly clashes on Monday in Khartoum.\n\n  \n\n   May 13, 2019: Sudan’s military and opposition agree on power structure \n\n Sudan’s military council and opposition groups have agreed to a power structure for the country’s transition but have yet to decide how long it will last or the make-up of transitional bodies, the council’s spokesman said on Monday (May 13).\n\n Protesters are pushing for a civilian-led transition and have kept up demonstrations against the council since military officers removed Bashir, who is now facing multiple criminal investigations, from power.\n\n On Monday they blocked roads in central Khartoum in an escalation of tactics after security forces used tear gas to disperse dozens of protesters across the Nile in Khartoum North, Reuters witnesses said.\n\n On day two demonstrators blocked Nile Street, a major avenue running south of the Blue Nile, placing burning branches and stones across the road.\n\n The military-civilian balance of power and the length of the transition have been key sticking points in talks between the council and an alliance of protest and opposition groups since former President Omar al-Bashir was ousted on April 11.\n\n REUTERS',

Abdul-Fattah Al-Burhan, arrived in Asmara in mid-morning hours today for working visit to #Eritrea. Delegation was accorded warm welcome by President Isaias Afwerki on arrival at Asmara\'s International Airport. pic.twitter.com/zGvV88o1sw— Yemane G. Meskel (@hawelti) June 14, 2019\n  \n\n   June 4, 2019: German envoy talks tough at special UNSC meeting on Sudan \n\n The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting to discuss events in Sudan after a deadly attack by security forces on protesters in Khartoum on Monday.\n\n One of the biggest pronouncements from the stakeout of the session was by the German envoy Ambassador Heusgen who warned against the use of force in a bid to achieve legitimacy.\n\n “Legitimacy cannot come from the barrel of a gun,” the German Mission to the UN quoted him in a tweet.\n\n Whiles expressing “deep concern over violence against protesters in #Sudan. He stresses the urgent need for a return to the negotiation table to bring about an inclusive, civilian-led transitional gov’t,” the tweet added.\n\n The June 3 attack led to the deaths of over 30 people whiles over 100 are reported to have sustained varied degrees of injuries. Protest leaders have vowed to escalate their push for civilian transition.\n\n Hours after the deadly removal of a sit-in by predominantly Rapid Special Forces, RSF, with the backing of other militia, the junta that deposed Omar Al-Bashir has scrapped previous agreements with protesters.\n\n The Abdul Fattah al-Burhan-led junta has also scheduled elections in nine months time, a time frame totally rejected by the protest leaders.\n\n The junta initially called for two-year transition. It later agreed a three-year period in what is now scrapped legislative deal with the protest leaders. \n\n Post-Bashir Sudan has proven to be a very difficult period as the country grapples with the aftershocks of a revolution that many believe is experiencing a counterrevolution engineered from outside the country by powerful players in the Gulf region – Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt.\n\n  On the situation in #Sudan: We are deeply worried about developments in #Khartoum. Violence against protesters cannot be justified and has to stop immediately. We call on parties to avoid escalation and to return to the negotiating table.— GermanForeignOffice (@GermanyDiplo) June 3, 2019\n  \n\n   June 3, 2019: Violent break up of Khartoum sit-in  \n\n Security forces stormed a protest camp in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Monday and opposition-linked medics said more than 30 people were killed in the worst violence since the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir in April.\n\n Footage shared on social media and verified by Reuters showed chaotic scenes of people fleeing through streets as sustained bursts of gunfire crackled in the air during violence that drew rapid Western and African censure.\n\n Witnesses said a sit-in next to the Defence Ministry, the focal point of anti-government protests that started in December, had been cleared. Protesters poured onto streets elsewhere in Khartoum and beyond in response, setting up barricades and roadblocks with rocks and burning tyres.\n\n A group of doctors linked to the opposition said 30 people had been “martyred” in Monday’s violence, with the toll expected to rise because not all casualties had been accounted for. The group had earlier said at least 116 people were wounded.\n\n The main protest group accused the ruling military council of perpetrating “a massacre” as it broke up the camp.\n\n The Transitional Military Council (TMC) denied that, with a spokesman, Lieutenant General Shams El Din Kabbashi, telling Reuters security forces were pursuing “unruly elements” who had fled to the protest site and caused chaos.\n\n “The Transitional Military Council regrets the way the situation unfolded, reaffirming its full commitment to the … safety of the citizens and renews its call for negotiations as soon as possible,” the council later said in a statement.\n\n Monday’s violence is likely to deal a blow to hopes for a restart to stalled talks and a negotiated settlement over who should govern in a transitional period after Bashir’s overthrow.\n\n Sudan’s public prosecutor on Monday ordered an investigation into the violence, state news agency SUNA said.\n\n   Early June 2019: Mass protest demanding transition \n\n Tens of thousands of Sudanese demonstrators converged on central Khartoum on Thursday night demanding civilian rule amid increasing tensions with the country’s military rulers who accused a protest encampment of threatening stability.\n\n The protest, which followed a two-day strike organised by demonstrators and opposition groups frustrated by a deadlock in talks on a transition to democracy, underscores the volatility of the situation in Sudan nearly two months after the military overthrew autocrat Omar al-Bashir.\n\n The head of the central Khartoum military region accused “unruly elements” of attacking a vehicle used by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and seizing it near the protest site.\n\n “The protest site has become unsafe and represents a danger to the revolution and the revolutionaries and threatens the coherence of the state and its national security,” General Bahar Ahmed al-Bahar, head of the central region in Khartoum said in a statement he read on television.\n\n REUTERS\n\n   May 23, 2019: Hemedti in Saudi, stalemate back home persists \n\n The two leaders of the Transitional Military Council, TMC, were in the news for different reasons on Thursday. Deputy head of TMC Mohamed Hamdan known as Hemedti arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit.\n\n He was met on arrival in Jeddah by Prince Khalid Faisal. Saudi has been blamed as one of the interferers in ongoings back in Sudan. They have since Bashir’s overthrow made financial support available to Sudan.\n\n Back home an opposition concession in transition talks was said to have been rejected by the TMC.\n\n A journalist closely following the talks, Yousra Elbagir said the coalition had offered the TMC leader, Abdul Fattah al Burhan the role of leader of the sovereign body that was to lead the three-year transition.\n\n But the TMC’s rejection was on the grounds that the coalition wanted a civilian Burhan to be leader – in which case he was expected to retire from the Army in order to hold the post. Neither the coalition or TMC have confirmed the report.\n\n “On negotiations, inside source tells me: “[Opposition] Coalition made a major concession: they offered to agree to Burhan being President/Head of the Presidential Council – on the condition that he retire from the Army. It was flatly rejected [by Transitional Military Council]” she sad in a tweet.\n\n  Vice Chair of the Transitional Military Council, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” arrives to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia today and met by Prince Khalid Faisal. pic.twitter.com/YDGsFIcj27— Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) May 23, 2019\n  \n\n   May 16, 2019: Roadblock removal starts, US lawmakers demand more pressure on junta \n\n The removal of roadblocks in parts of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, has started according to multiple reports.\n\n The many roadblocks that had crippled movement across Khartoum led to the suspension of civilian-led transition talks between the military junta and protest leaders.\n\n The military said it had suspended the talks for 72 hours effective Thursday morning. The protest leaders hit back at the move describing it as a surprise tactic by the military.\n\n  Nile Street is now officially open, after protesters clear barricades.\n\nFb live stream:.https://t.co/qhzEeDabTj— Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) May 17, 2019\n  \n\n Meanwhile, a group of United States Senators have reiterated a call for America to stand with the Sudanese people in their fight to achieve a democratic country.\n\n In a May 16 letter to the U.S. Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, the 92 bipartisan lawmakers said: “This is a critical moment for Sudan, one that came about because of the Sudanese people took to the streets to demand it.\n\n “It is also critical for the United States to support Sudanese citizen’s demands for real democratic change.” The protests that started since December 2018 has led to the ouster and arrest of long serving Omar al-Bashir.\n\n   May 16, 2019: Roadblock removal blocks transition talks \n\n Days after the military and protest leaders agreed on a deal to lead Sudan out of a post-Bashir political flux, there is a new headache in the form of mounted roadblocks.\n\n The Transitional Military Council, TMC, is calling for all roadblocks particularly in a designated area in the capital to be removed.\n\n The measure had been one of the effective means that protesters have used in pressing for their demands. Vehicular movement has been largely restricted due to the roadblocks.\n\n Protesters have also camped around these roadblocks as part of a sit-in around the premises of the military headquarters. Attempts to forcibly remove the roadblocks have failed despite claiming lives of some protesters and a security official.\n\n The two parties have agreed for a three-year transition period to a civilian administration. The opposition alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council. The sticking point is about who gets what number of seats on the sovereign council.\n\n   May 15, 2019: South Sudan president comments on crisis \n\n The military junta that deposed Omar al-Bashir have agreed a deal transition deal with the opposition alliance. This follows weeks of back and forth over post-Bashir Sudan.\n\n How long: The two parties have agreed for a three-year transition period to a civilian administration.\n\n Legislative make up: The Transitional Military Council (TMC) disclosed that  the alliance would have two-thirds of the seats on a legislative council.\n\n  TMC & opposition joint presser now:\n\nThey have agreed on a transitional period of three years & a legislative council comprising of 300 members, 67% will be signatories of the Declaration of Freedom & Change and 33% will not.\n\nNo mention of composition of ruling council.— Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) May 14, 2019\n  \n\n Sticking point: the configuration of a sovereign council is what remains outstanding. The military and civilians have disagreed on who gets majority of seats on the council.\n\n The last time the military made concessions on the issue, they said the best they could do was to allow for equal representation.\n\n   May 14, 2019: South Sudan president comments on crisis \n\n President Salva Kiir of South Sudan has asked that the sovereignty of Sudan be respected in this time of political uncertainty as the country works towards a transition.\n\n “It is important to remind international and regional actors not to interfere in Sudan. The people of Sudan are perfectly capable of managing their own affairs. Let us prove the world wrong.\n\n “We are not war mongers, we are peace loving people and we are a proud and dignified nation,” he said on Tuesday during the opening of the second session of the South Sudan parliament in Juba. \n\n Meanwhile, over in Sudan, post-Bashir flux continues. Transition deadlock between the junta that ousted Bashir and protest leaders is reportedly making headway.\n\n The Khartoum sit-ins that have crippled movement in key areas of the capital continues. Reports indicate that in the second city Omdurman, protesters have blocked roads after deadly clashes on Monday in Khartoum.\n\n  \n\n   May 13, 2019: Sudan’s military and opposition agree on power structure \n\n Sudan’s military council and opposition groups have agreed to a power structure for the country’s transition but have yet to decide how long it will last or the make-up of transitional bodies, the council’s spokesman said on Monday (May 13).\n\n Protesters are pushing for a civilian-led transition and have kept up demonstrations against the council since military officers removed Bashir, who is now facing multiple criminal investigations, from power.\n\n On Monday they blocked roads in central Khartoum in an escalation of tactics after security forces used tear gas to disperse dozens of protesters across the Nile in Khartoum North, Reuters witnesses said.\n\n On day two demonstrators blocked Nile Street, a major avenue running south of the Blue Nile, placing burning branches and stones across the road.\n\n The military-civilian balance of power and the length of the transition have been key sticking points in talks between the council and an alliance of protest and opposition groups since former President Omar al-Bashir was ousted on April 11.\n\n REUTERS',

      content: 'The African Development Bank and its partners on Wednesday launched the Africa Digital Financial Inclusion Facility (ADFI), designed to aid safety and expansion of digital financial transactions in Africa.\n\n The Fund, launched at the Bank’s Annual Meetings in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the Government of Luxembourg, as initial contributors.\n\n The goal is to ensure that at least 320 million more Africans, of which nearly 60% are women, have access to digital financial services. The fund will deploy $100 million in grants and $300 million in the form of debt from the Bank’s ordinary capital resources by 2030, to scale up electronic financial services for low-income communities.\n\n “We believe that with the right investments in innovation and smart digital growth, the obstacles to achieving financial inclusion and greater economic opportunity for all will be overcome,” African Development Bank President Akinwunmi Adesina said.\n\n The interventions will be aligned to four pillars; infrastructure, including digital and interoperable payment systems; digital products and innovation; policy and regulatory reform and harmonisation; and capacity building. It will help to close the transaction gender gap between men and women.\n\n Africa saw double-digit growth in mobile phone ownership in the first half of this decade, triggering a surge in innovative digital tools and services across the continent. Yet, the benefits are not shared equally. It is estimated that only 43% of adults across Africa have a banking account.\n\n “Financial inclusion, achieved through digital financial service models, is simultaneously a powerful anti-poverty strategy and a catalyst of sustainable economic development for national and regional economies,” said Michael Wiegand, Director of the Financial Services for the Poor Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n ADFI’s opening project, which serves as a pilot for the facility, is a $11.3 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the Bank and the Central Bank of West African States. The grant will create an interoperable digital payment system that will allow consumers to send and receive money between mobile wallets, and from these wallets to other digital and bank accounts.\n\n “With ADFI, we are convinced that our joint efforts can contribute efficiently to bring down the barriers that still undermine the full potential of digital finance in Africa. It will enhance the delivery of quality and responsible digital financial services to the underserved, a cornerstone to inclusive and sustainable financial systems. AFD welcomes the specific attention that will be given to women’s digital financial inclusion in the evaluation of the projects to be supported,” said Sébastien Minot, AFD’s Deputy Head for Africa.\nThe ADFI will work with banks and non-bank financial institutions, mobile network operators, remittance and payment service providers, fintech companies, government ministries, regulatory bodies as well as regional economic organisations.\n\n “Luxembourg believes that poverty reduction and social cohesion go hand-in-hand with economic empowerment and financial inclusion. ADFI provides an excellent platform for Luxembourg to combine its focus on economic inclusion with its Fintech orientation for the benefit of Africa’s poor,” said Georges Heine, Alternate Governor for the African Development Bank from the Luxembourg Ministry of Finance.\n\n A three-member panel including Bank Vice President Pierre Guislain, Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, discussed modalities, expected challenges and policy requirements that must be in place to enable the fund achieve its goals.\n\n Other members were Vanessa Moungar, Bank Director of Gender, Women and Civil Society, and Konstantin Peric, deputy Director, Financial Services for the Poor at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.',

Since World War Two, almost 69 million people globally have been forced to flee war and violence.\n\n The WHO’s conflict mental health study, published in The Lancet medical journal, was carried out by a team of researchers from the WHO, Australia’s Queensland University, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and Harvard University in the United States.\n\n It analyzed research from 129 studies and data from 39 countries published between 1980 and August 2017.\n\n Regions that have seen conflict in the last 10 years were included and mental illnesses were categorized as either mild, moderate or severe. Natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as Ebola, were not included.\n\n Overall in war zones, the average prevalence was highest for mild mental health conditions, at 13%. Around 4% of people living amid armed conflict had moderate mental health illness, and for severe conditions the prevalence was 5%.\n\n The study also found that rates of depression and anxiety in conflict settings appeared to increase with age, and depression was more common among women than men.\n\n The study was funded by the WHO, the Queensland Department of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n Reuters',

Investors were put off by a dispute between the government and South African telecom giant MTN over repatriated profits.

Italy’s Eni Group was behind Ghana’s largest greenfield investment project.\n\n Ethiopia remained East Africa’s top recipient of FDI at $3.3 billion, despite an 18% drop compared with the year before.\n\n Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania all saw increases in FDI inflows. Foreign investment in Uganda jumped 67% to a record $1.3 billion, boosted by the oil and gas development of a consortium that includes France’s Total, CNOOC of China and London-listed Tullow Oil.\n\n The creation of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp could help support FDI inflows this year.

      content: 'Krachi west district has been identified as a major transit point for child trafficking and child labour.\n\n This became known during a study tour by the centre for human rights, conflict, and peace studies at the University of Education Winneba in the district.\n\n Peter Quao Adattor who was with the study group reports, seven child labourers were rescued within a spate of two hours on the lake.\n\n Human trafficking is a global problem affecting millions of people and many countries. In Ghana, the internal trafficking of children into hazardous labour is a major challenge. Many Ghanaian children are trafficked from their home villages to work in the fishing industry. Fishers desperate to sustain their income exploit these kids living in meager conditions and working long hours.\n\n However, statistics on the number of children in what many referred to as modern-day slavery remained scanty and often debatable. A recent an assessment conducted by the international justice mission, IJM, found that 57.6 percent of children working on southern lake Volta’s waters were trafficked into the forced labour. The report further identified the majority of the lake child labourers as too young to legally conduct the hazardous tasks inherent in many aspects of the fishing industry.\n\n At least one out of five of children identified in the lake fishing was six years old or younger according to the report. A recent documentary produced by CNN on the lake further corroborated this assertion.\n\n However, these reports were met with mixed reaction, especially from policymakers. The development prompted the centre for human rights, conflict, and peace, at the University of Education, Winneba, into a fact finding the mission at Kete-Krachi, where the practices is reportedly rife. The university study team encountered a number of children in hazardous labour within two hours of cruising on the lake.\n\n Some of the child labourers, aged between 8 and 12 years, were working without supervision whilst others appeared severely malnourished.\n\n This prompted the group, with support from PACODEP, a local NGO, to rescue seven of those encountered between 7.00am and 9.00am. \n\n But this was not without a struggle. All the children we encountered together with their masters put up fierce resistance. They claimed to be attending school but could not explain why they were found on the lake engaged in fishing activities on a Friday morning. This particular one went on his knees crying and begging the team not to remove him from the condition.\n\n The team proceeded to Ogetse, one of the island communities where three of the seven rescued children came from. There is a basic school with an acceptable number of teachers. However, most parents prioritize fishing ahead of their ward’s education.\n\n The statistics from the Krachi west district, social works is staggering requiring pragmatic action.\n\n Human right watchers say Ghana may not attain most of the sustainable development goals if pragmatic steps are not taken to address the wide spread of child trafficking and child labour.\n\n This exploitative act, unless checked and eliminated, attaining SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, that seeks to ensure no poverty, no hunger, good health, quality education as well as good jobs and economic growth will continue to elude the country.\n\n The rescued children are currently at the village of life, a caregiving home and educational facility for rescued child labourers, beginning a new life journey with 98 other inmates.',

Members of the kingdom’s repressed Shiite minority took to the streets, calling for equal rights and a fairer distribution of oil revenues. The protesters included a group of around 30 kids on bicycles. As a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/middleeast/saudi-teen-death-penalty-intl/">video</a> released last week by CNN shows, those children were led by a smiling 10-year-old in flip-flops named Murtaja Qureiris.</p>\n<p>“The people demand human rights!” the young boy can be seen shouting through a megaphone.</p>\n<p>Here’s the problem: Demanding human rights in Saudi Arabia lands you in prison. Even if you’re a kid.</p>\n<p>Three years later, in September 2014, 13-year-old Murtaja was arrested while on his way to neighboring Bahrain with his family.</p>\n<p>“At the time,” reports <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/middleeast/saudi-teen-death-penalty-intl/">CNN</a>, “he was considered by lawyers and activists to be the youngest known political prisoner in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Over the past four years, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/middleeast/saudi-teenager-death-sentence.html">say</a> human rights groups, this teenager has been subjected to torture and intimidation, as well as a spell in solitary confinement. He has been denied access to a lawyer while interrogators try to get him to confess to the trumped-up charges against him. These include “participating in anti-government protests, attending the funeral of his brother Ali Qureiris who was killed in a protest in 2011, joining a ‘terrorist organization,’ throwing Molotov cocktails at a police station, and firing at security forces,” according to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/saudi-arabia-authorities-must-not-resort-to-use-of-death-penalty-against-protester-arrested-aged-13/">Amnesty International</a>.</p>\n<p>Last week, we <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-teenager-faces-execution-for-alleged-crimes-committed-as-a-child/2019/06/10/b4b356cc-8b76-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html?utm_term=.a99386fd92b0">learned</a> that Saudi prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 18-year-old Murtaja, who is being tried in an anti-terror court. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/middleeast/saudi-teen-death-penalty-intl/">CNN</a> reports that the prosecutors want to “impose the harshest form of the death penalty, which may include crucifixion or dismemberment after execution.”</p>\n<p>Got that? The unelected government of a close ally of the United States is planning on brutally executing an 18-year-old member of a minority group, for crimes allegedly committed when he was 10 years old.</p>\n<p>Let me repeat: Ten. Years. Old.</p>\n<p>We shouldn&#8217;t forget the person who is primarily responsible for this outrage: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS. Since his father installed him in power, the violent crushing of political dissent has escalated. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html">According to the CIA</a>, MBS ordered the horrific murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He is also behind the <a href="https://time.com/5585281/cia-warned-jamal-khashoggi-associates/">targeting</a> of three Arab activists in Norway, Canada, and the United States.</p>\n<p>Much has (rightly) been made of the crown prince’s shocking record on extrajudicial killings. But what of the growing number of judicially sanctioned killings inside of Saudi Arabia on his watch? The planned execution of Murtaja Qureiris may be the most horrendous act yet.</p>\n<p>“There should be no doubt that the Saudi Arabian authorities are ready to go to any length to crack down on dissent against their own citizens, including by resorting to the death penalty for men who were merely boys at the time of their arrest,” <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/saudi-arabia-authorities-must-not-resort-to-use-of-death-penalty-against-protester-arrested-aged-13/">says</a> Lynn Maalouf, Middle East research director at Amnesty International.</p>\n<p>The Gulf kingdom is one of the world’s <a href="https://www.independent.ie/world-news/death-penalty-report-reveals-which-country-is-the-worlds-top-executioner-36800409.html">top executioners</a> and, according to Maalouf, Saudi authorities have “a chilling track record of using the death penalty as a weapon to crush political dissent and punish anti-government protesters — including children — from the country’s persecuted Shi’a minority.”</p>\n<p>The majority of the country, and the ruling family, are from a strict school of Sunni Islam called Salafism. In April, 37 people were executed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/23/middleeast/saudi-executions-terror-intl/index.html">in a single day</a> — the biggest mass execution in the kingdom since 2016 — and the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/04/saudi-arabia-37-put-to-death-in-shocking-execution-spree/">vast majority</a> of them were believed to be Shiites. Three of them, according to human rights group <a href="https://reprieve.org.uk/update/saudi-arabia-executes-37-people-in-a-single-day-including-three-juveniles/">Reprieve</a>, were “minors at the time of their alleged offences.” Such executions, as both Reprieve and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/">Amnesty International</a> have noted, are a brazen violation of international human rights law.</p>\n<p>Another <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/04/saudi-arabia-37-put-to-death-in-shocking-execution-spree/">three Saudi Shiites</a> — Ali al-Nimr, Dawood al-Marhoon, and Abdullah al-Zaher — who were also below the age of 18 at the time of their alleged crimes, are still on death row and could be executed at anytime.</p>\n<p class="p1"><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div></p>\n<p>It isn’t just Shiites, either. MBS has also targeted Sunni clerics who have failed to fall into line. There have been <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-saudi-arabia-execute-three-prominent-moderate-scholars-after-ramadan">reports</a> that the belligerent and thin-skinned crown prince plans on executing three high-profile Saudi religious scholars — Salman al-Odah, Awad al-Qarni, and Ali al-Omari — all of whom have been held on multiple charges of “terrorism.” 62-year-old Odah is famous in the Arab world for his relatively progressive views on <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Saudi-cleric-Homosexuality-not-a-deviation-from-Islam-should-not-be-punished-452957">Islam and homosexuality</a> and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/opinion/21iht-edgerges.1.7596468.html">2007 denunciation</a> of Osama bin Laden. His actual “crime”? <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/07/saudi-arabia-cleric-held-4-months-without-charge">Tweeting</a> a prayer for reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf rival, the Emirate of Qatar. (Full disclosure: I host two <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/">TV</a> <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/">shows</a> for Qatar-funded Al Jazeera English.)</p>\n<p>Supporters of MBS often try and argue that these executions are the product of decisions made in court, not in the royal palace. This is a laughable defense. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy. There is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/al-rasheed-saudi-arabia-needs-independent-judiciary/vi-AAAZ2As">no independent judiciary</a>. As <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/middleeast/saudi-teen-death-penalty-intl/">CNN</a> reports, “The death penalty can only be enforced by order of King Salman or his authorized representative. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is frequently characterized as the King’s deputy.”</p>\n<p>Forget MBS <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/opinion/saudi-prince-mbs-arab-spring.html">the reformer</a>; meet MBS <a href="http://www.worldcoalition.org/Mass-executions-in-Saudi-Arabia-with-more-than-100-people-executed-since-January-2019-.html">the executioner</a>. The fact that he has been embraced closely by everyone from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/trump-releases-statement-support-saudi-arabia/576436/">Donald Trump</a> to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/09/emmanuel-macron-treats-saudi-crown-prince-private-dinner-louvre/">Emmanuel Macron</a> to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/saudi-prince-poses-with-pm-on-controversial-visit-11280077">Theresa May</a> should be a source of shame for those of us living in the West. To <a href="https://twitter.com/TVietor08/status/1136417531282018307">quote</a> former Obama-era National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor, MBS is “Kim Jong Un with oil money.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/16/saudi-crown-prince-child-execution/">Saudi Arabia May Execute Teenager for His Protests &#8212; Including When He Was 10</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

      content: 'June 17: Kenya Ebola scare, WHO chief visits DRC, Uganda \n\n Kenyan doctors are testing a hospital patient in western Kenya who has Ebola-like symptoms, as eastern Congo is struggling to control the outbreak that has killed 1,400 and which has spread to neighboring Uganda where two deaths have been caused by the deadly hemorrhagic fever.\n\n If the Kenyan patient is confirmed as having Ebola, it would be the East African country’s first ever case of the virus and represent a worrying spread of the disease from eastern Congo. Kenya has never experienced an Ebola outbreak and some Kenyan doctors have expressed concern about the country’s preparedness to manage the deadly virus.\n\n The female patient in Kenya is in isolation at Kericho County Referral Hospital where staff took precautions to ensure minimal contact, county spokesman Timothy Kimei said in a statement.\n\n The patient had visited her spouse at the Uganda-Kenya border and three other family members are also under observation, according to Kenyan media.\n\n However, Kenya’s health minister downplayed the threat Monday.\n\n  “I wish to reassure all Kenyans and our visitors that we do not have any cases of Ebola and indeed the ministry has undertaken and continues to implement the preparedness measures,” SicilyKariuki said during a tour of JKIA port of entry office PDUDelivery CapitalFMKenya pic.twitter.com/1M1jFWmTPX— Ministry of Health (MOH_Kenya) June 17, 2019\n\n “The rapid surveillance and response team, which has been sent to examine the patient who is in stable condition, has confirmed that she does not fit the case definition of Ebola. Allow me to repeat to Kenyans that the patient does not meet the case definition of Ebola,” said Sicily Kariuki, while touring the Nairobi international airport to see how arriving passengers are screened for symptoms of fever.\n\n “Precautionary measures have, however, been put in place including isolation of the patient and submission of blood samples … for testing,” she said. “The result of the same are expected by 4 p.m. this evening (Kenya time).”\n\n Uganda last week reported two deaths from Ebola that had spread from eastern Congo, where the current outbreak has caused more than 1,400 deaths since August.

      content: 'Bombs in Cameroon, Kenya and Somalia over the weekend killed at least 12 police officers, and injured dozens as authorities struggle to contain the Anglophone security crisis and the Al Shabaab insurgency respectively.\n\n While authorities blamed the bombing in Cameroon on separatists from the English-speaking regions, the terrorist group Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombs in Kenya and Somalia.\n\n  Cameroon’s separatists accused of detonating bomb\n\n Cameroon’s government said on Sunday that separatists in its restive English-speaking region had detonated an improvised explosive device that killed four police and wounded six.\n\n “The government condemns in the strongest terms this criminal act, perpetrated by armed bandits and terrorists with no faith or law,” the statement said. It also said the attack occurred along a road near the district of Eyumojock in the south west of the country late on Saturday.\n\n There was no immediate reaction or claim of responsibility from any separatist group.\n\n It is rare but not unheard of for the separatists to use bomb technology, but this would mark their first deadly strike using a bomb.\n\n What began as peaceful protests in Cameroon’s southwestern Anglophone region in 2017 have degenerated into near daily violence between the forces of Cameroon’s mostly French-speaking government and several separatist groups.\n\n The English-speaking Northwest and Southwest of the country complain of being marginalised by the French speaking majority.\n\n Cameroon’s linguistic divide has existed since the end of World War One, when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun, in central Africa, between allied victors, leaving most of Cameroon French-administered but a small part run by Britain.\n\n  READ MORE: Cameroon govt lacks will for true dialogue over Anglophone crisis\n\n  Police officers killed in Kenya\n\n Somali militants killed eight Kenyan police with a roadside bomb near the border between the two countries on Saturday, officials said.\n\n The vehicle that was hit by the roadside bomb was carrying 11 policemen, police spokesman Charles Owino told Reuters. A local official said eight were killed.\n\n “Eight bodies were found and taken to Wajir. Two were rescued, but they are in critical condition,” said Muhumed Ali Gedi, a member of the local community security team from Wajir who witnessed the rescue mission.\n\n Saturday’s attack came hardly 24 hours after three Kenyan police reservists were kidnapped from the same area, in Wajir district in northeast Kenya.\n\n Kenyan military forces have occupied part of southern Somalia along the border since 2011. The Kenyans, along with allied Somali militia, wrested control of the territory from al Shabaab jihadists after a spate of kidnappings on Kenyan soil.\n\n  ALSO READ: Kenya indefinitely closes border with Somalia, trade ban imposed\n\n  8 killed, dozens injured in Mogadishu\n\n Still on Saturday, al Shabaab detonated two bombs in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, killing at least eight people.\n\n Police said the first blast, at a busy junction known as K4, was a car bomb intercepted by security services that caused no casualties.\n\n The other blast killed eight people and injured 16, said Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Aamin ambulance service.\n\n Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab’s spokesman for military operations, said the group was responsible for the blast in Kenya and the two in Mogadishu.\n\n Al Shabaab is fighting the weak, U.N.-backed Somali government and its international allies in a quest to impose strict Islamic law.',

      content: 'South Africa vs Afghanistan\n\n South Africa on Saturday registered their first win at the 2019 Men’s Cricket World Cup, beating Afghanistan by nine wickets.\n\n The match at the Cardiff Wales Stadium offered the Proteas a last chance to salvage their chances at the tournament that they have never won. \n\n Leg-spinner Imran Tahir took 4-29, engineering an Afghani collapse after a 75-minute rain break as they were dismissed for 125. Chris Morris contributed with figures of 3-13 and Andile Phehlukwayo took two wickets.\n\n The South Africans set about chasing a slightly adjusted target of 127 from 48 overs in cautious fashion, reaching 131-1 with 19 overs to spare.\n\n After their poor start to the tournament, South Africa effectively need to win their remaining four matches, starting with New Zealand in Birmingham on Wednesday, to make the last four.\n\n  South Africa gets 1st point\n\n Raain gifted South Africa their first point at the World Cup as the game against West Indies was washed out, and both teams awarded a point.\n\n The Proteas have struggled to impress in the four matches they have so far played, losing against England, Bangladesh and India.\n\n  South Africa vs India\n\n South Africa slumped to a third straight loss at the Cricket World Cup, falling to India by six wickets on Wednesday.\n\n Wily Indian wrist-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal took four wickets as one of the pre-tournament favourites got their Cricket World Cup campaign off to a confident start by restricting South Africa to 227 for nine at a vibrant Rose Bowl.\n\n Chasing South Africa’s 227-9, India lost opener Shikhar Dhawan for eight and then batting mainstay Kohli for 18 with the score on 54-2 at the Rose bowl in Southampton.\n\n Opener Rohit, however, ensured the victory ended up being a comfortable one with an unbeaten 122 as India reached their target with six wickets in hand and 15 balls to spare.\n\n The innings mirrored South Africa’s World Cup campaign to date as their batsmen struggled to find form or fluency on wickets that were good for striking. They have lost their opening two matches to England and Bangladesh, while India were playing their first game.\n\n  Bangladesh upsets South Africa\n\n South Africa suffered its second successive defeat at the 2019 Cricket World Cup, losing by 21 runs to Bangladesh.\n\n Bangladesh piled up their highest one-day International total, underlining their reputation as dangerous outsiders at the tournament.\n\n Mushfiqur and Shakib added 142 runs for the third wicket to notch up Bangladesh’s highest World Cup partnership in an aggressive batting display backed by enthusiastic support.\n\n That meant South Africa needed to pull off the highest run chase in World Cup history, but they ended on 309 for eight and with their next game against India on Wednesday, their chances of making the semi-finals are already under threat.\n\n The country’s former all-rounder Jacques Kallis said the Proteas cannot afford any more mistakes at the World Cup and will need to win almost all their remaining seven games if they hope to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\n “I think you’ll need six wins, maybe five with a really good run rate, to finish in the top four,” Kallis said in a column for the International Cricket Council.\n\n “So South Africa almost need to win every game they will play. There will be no margin for error.\n\n The top four teams from the new round-robin format qualify for the semi-finals and defeat against India on Wednesday could also potentially affect South Africa’s net run rate, which will decide the final standings if teams are tied on points and wins.\n\n REUTERS\n\n  Loss to England\n\n Africa’s sole representatives at the 2019 Cricket World Cup, South Africa got off to a losing start against hosts England in the first game of the six-week tournament.\n\n Ben Stokes top-scored with 89 as the hosts made a competitive total of 311 for eight after being sent into bat.\n\n Jofra Archer took two early wickets and South Africa never looked likely to reach their target, bowled out in the 40th over for 207 to give World Cup favourites England the perfect start.\n\n The Duke of Sussex addressed the crowd at The Oval, saying: “Cities will come alive across the next six weeks as World Cup fever sweeps the nation once more…I am now honoured to declare the men’s World Cup of 2019 open.”\n\n South Africa, who have never won the 50-over tournament arrived for the latest edition with high hopes. The Proteas have lost in the semi-finals four times, and are ranked third, behind India.\n\n “We were outplayed in all three departments. Jofra Archer took two wickets up front and Hashim Amla (injured) as well, so it was basically three down,” South Africa’s Du Plessis said.\n\n “I thought 300 was par but there were some really good batting performances from England.”\n\n  SUGGESTED READING: Will Africa bring home a World Cup this year?',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>A law key</u> to preventing state welfare agencies from separating Indigenous children from their families is at risk of being overturned thanks to the yearslong effort of a network of libertarian and right-wing organizations.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, between a quarter and a third of Indigenous children across the United States had been removed from their homes. Social services often cited neglect or deprivation — euphemisms for poverty — as grounds for placing children in the custody of non-Native families and institutions, offering birth parents little opportunity for redress. Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978 in order to reform a system designed to destroy Indigenous people.</p>\n<p>Last October, a U.S. district judge in Texas declared the law unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection clause, arguing that it creates a separate set of practices for a so-called racial group. The federal government and four tribes appealed the decision, which is currently pending before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. If the ruling is upheld and the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, it could not only upend protections for the nation’s most vulnerable children, but also undermine a foundational concept of Indian law: that to be Indian is political, not racial.</p>\n<p>The campaign against the Indian Child Welfare Act fits into a wider right-wing effort to legally challenge civil rights-era gains that have remained instrumental in shielding marginalized communities from America’s foundational systems of discrimination and genocide.</p>\n<p>Leading the charge against the law is the Goldwater Institute, which brands itself as a “free-market public policy research and litigation organization” that supports limited government and private property rights. The institute has <a href="https://goldwaterinstitute.org/indian-child-welfare-act/">participated</a> in 12 cases challenging ICWA in the last five years. The Texas decision is its biggest victory yet. The Cato Institute and the Project on Fair Representation, founded by the strategist responsible for two major Supreme Court cases challenging affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act, also filed briefs in the Texas case.</p>\n<p>Tribal leaders, child advocates, and attorneys specializing in Indian law worry that if the Texas ruling is upheld, it could open the door to constitutional challenges of a range of federal laws based on Native American tribes’ political relationship with the U.S. government, including the Major Crimes Act, which establishes the federal government’s law enforcement role on reservations; the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which governs casinos on tribal land; federal policies that allow tribes to regulate the oil and gas industry; and programs that offer housing and health care to Native American communities.</p>\n<p>Timothy Sandefur, Goldwater’s vice president for litigation, claims that the Texas decision is “a major step forward for the rights of Indian children in this country and their parents.” But 31 child welfare organizations disagree, writing in an amicus <a href="https://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/caseyamicusbrief.pdf">brief</a> that ICWA “both embodies and has served as a model for the child welfare policies that are best practices generally.”</p>\n<p>Shannon Smith, executive director of the ICWA Law Center in Minnesota, rejects Goldwater’s assertion that taking down ICWA would be good for children. “This is very misguided, and the potential impacts to Indian children and their connection to families and tribes could be devastating.”</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-255010" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/young-students-classroom-1560541470.png" alt="young-students-classroom-1560541470" /></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">Students in a classroom at the Carlisle Indian School, circa 1900-1910.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center</p></div>\n<h3>“Kill the Indian, Save the Man”</h3>\n<p>The U.S. government’s efforts to “kill the Indian, save the man” via removal of Native children from their communities dates to the opening of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879. Hundreds of thousands of children were placed in institutions where they were typically not allowed to speak their language or practice their culture. Later, the <a href="http://www.indigenouspolicy.org/index.php/ipj/article/view/4/3">Indian Adoption Project</a> placed hundreds of Native children in the custody of white families between 1958 and 1967.</p>\n<p>In a remarkable series of Senate <a href="https://narf.org/nill/documents/icwa/federal/lh/hear040874/hear040874.pdf">hearings</a> in 1974, family after family described children who were disappeared by the state with no notice or court hearing, welfare agents repeatedly requesting that mothers give up their newborns, and kids making plans to hide if child services showed up to take them away.</p>\n<p>The Indian Child Welfare Act, passed four years later, set a high bar for the removal of Indigenous children from their parents, requiring “active” efforts to avoid the breakup of an American Indian family. That might mean a social worker driving a parent struggling with chemical dependency to treatment, rather than simply mandating that they go or handing them a brochure. Before a parent’s rights can be terminated, ICWA requires evidence “beyond a reasonable doubt” that continued custody would result in serious physical or emotional damage. And when a removal does occur, child welfare agencies must first attempt to place the child with a family member, then with a member of their tribe, then with a member of another tribe.</p>\n<p>The law has been important for curbing the flow of children out of Indigenous communities, but it fell short of eliminating the problem. A 2011 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/10/25/141662357/incentives-and-cultural-bias-fuel-foster-system">NPR series</a> found that, despite the availability of licensed Native foster parents, 90 percent of Indigenous kids in foster care in South Dakota were still placed in group homes or with non-Native families. In Minnesota, Native kids are 17 times more likely than non-Native kids to be removed from their parents.</p>\n<p>In recent years, as advocates for Indigenous families were fighting to strengthen ICWA, a concerted effort to undermine the law emerged in the form of non-Native couples attempting to adopt Native children.</p>\n<p>The lead plaintiffs in the Texas case are Jennifer and Chad Brackeen, a white couple who sought to adopt a Navajo baby they had fostered for a year. After the tribe’s attempt to place him with an adoptive Navajo family fell through, the Brackeens were able to keep the child. But their lawsuit argued that a provision of ICWA allowing tribes to contest an adoption for up to two years threatened the integrity of their family.</p>\n<p>What happened in the wake of the Texas ruling demonstrates what losing ICWA can mean for Native families. The adopted child’s biological mother had another baby that she planned to put up for adoption. The baby girl’s great aunt, Alvetta James, sought to adopt her, making the case that she would maintain connections to her culture and family in James’s care, according to a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/health/navajo-children-custody-fight.html">profile</a>. But the Brackeens asserted that they were the best family for the sibling, and in May, a family court judge agreed, citing the ruling that found ICWA unconstitutional and giving them primary custody of the baby girl.</p>\n<h3>The Definition of “Indian”</h3>\n<p>ICWA applies to children who have a parent who is a tribal member and are eligible for membership, even if they have not yet been enrolled. According to U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, who presided over the Texas case, the fact that a baby who has not yet been enrolled in a tribe could be called “Indian” means the designation is racial, not political.</p>\n<p>“Babies don’t get born and run down to the citizenship office and file a petition,” said Matthew Fletcher, director of the Indigenous Law and Policy Center at Michigan State University. When his own child was born, he and his partner took a year to register him as a tribal member, in part because he was eligible for more than one tribal nation. “To say that somehow this kid hasn’t been enrolled yet and therefore doesn’t have a political relationship is really quite disingenuous.”</p>\n<p>The political relationship Native Americans maintain with the U.S. government dates back to treaty commitments the government made between 1778 and 1868 in exchange for the millions of acres of land that constitute the United States. The treaties form the basis of what’s known as the “trust relationship” between Native nations and the United States. ICWA is part of a body of law meant to fulfill the U.S. government’s trust responsibility.</p>\n<p>The reason the distinction between racial and political matters is that under the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause, laws that differentiate on the basis of race are subject to a higher level of scrutiny in the courts and must be narrowly tailored to fulfill an important government interest.</p>\n<p>Over the years, various parties have attempted to raise equal protection challenges to Indian laws. Despite numerous legal attacks, O’Connor is the first judge to declare ICWA unconstitutional. “Basically, the judge is saying that any federal statute with the word &#8216;Indian&#8217; in it should be subject to strict scrutiny,” Fletcher said.</p>\n<p>The Goldwater Institute, the Cato Institute, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, and the Academy of Adoption and Assisted Reproduction Attorneys claimed in an appellate brief that concerns about the Brackeen decision’s potential to undermine Indian law more widely are “radically overblown.” But even as the ICWA ruling is being appealed, at least one attorney has already signaled willingness to use it to challenge the Major Crimes Act — a foundational law that gives the federal government jurisdiction over certain crimes committed by Indian people on Indian land, such as murder, rape, and burglary.</p>\n<p>Derrick Jim, a Navajo man from Arizona, was sentenced to life in prison for raping a woman at a party at her house. Because he’s legally an Indian and the assault took place in the Navajo Nation, he was tried in federal court. Had he been tried in New Mexico’s state system, his sentence might have been lighter. In an appeal filed at the end of April, his lawyer asked the judge to preserve Jim’s right to bring his case to the Supreme Court and challenge the constitutionality of the Major Crimes Act should the Texas ICWA ruling be upheld.</p>\n<p>According to Fletcher, loss of the Major Crimes Act could throw the legal system into disarray and allow more violent crimes on tribal land to be committed with impunity. “The majority of tribes don’t have the capacity to exercise criminal jurisdiction,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Fletcher pointed out that the same arguments advanced in the Texas decision have been used by private casinos attempting to overturn laws that allow Indian gaming. He expressed concern that, if upheld, the Brackeen decision could also be used to argue against Environmental Protection Agency policies that grant some tribes the right to enforce the oil and gas industry’s compliance with environmental regulations.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-255022" src="https://prod01-cdn05.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/h_15223863-1560542239-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chad and Jennifer Brackeen with their two biological children and Zachary, 3, center, a Native American boy at the center of a bitter court battle, at home near Fort Worth, Texas, May 31, 2019.

Smith/The New York Times via Redux</p></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration has <a href="https://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/mancari-11-19.pdf">repeatedly</a> signaled other ways a redefinition of “Indian” as racial could be used to take away welfare benefits that fulfill the U.S. government’s treaty responsibilities to Native people. In a 2017 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-h-r-244-law/">signing statement</a> for an appropriations bill, Trump listed Native American Housing Block Grants among programs he described as allocating benefits “on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender.” He said he planned to treat those programs as subject to equal protection requirements — suggesting that Native housing benefits for communities where affordable housing is notoriously rare and rundown might be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the administration attempted to use the same argument to deny Native people access to Medicaid. After several states passed laws requiring Medicaid recipients to fulfill work requirements, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied requests for exemptions for Native Americans, many of whom live on isolated reservations where jobs are difficult to find. The administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/22/trump-native-americans-historical-standing-492794">cited</a> constitutional concerns that the exemption would be a racial preference.</p>\n<p>“The United States has a legal responsibility to provide health care to Native Americans,” Mary Smith, who headed Indian Health Service under Barack Obama, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/22/trump-native-americans-historical-standing-492794">Politico</a>. “It’s the largest prepaid health system in the world — they’ve paid through land and massacres — and now you’re going to take away health care and add a work requirement?”</p>\n<p>Eventually, the administration backed down and allowed the exemptions, but many experts in Indian law see clear warning signs that the Trump administration has benefits to Native people in its crosshairs.</p>\n<h3>Behind the Legal Attacks</h3>\n<p>Sandefur, the Goldwater Institute lawyer, insists that concern for children drives his interest in ICWA. “I know that there’s a lot of skepticism on the left toward our motives about this,” he told The Intercept, “that this is all some sort of secret Koch brothers conspiracy to destroy Indian tribes and all this bullshit.” In fiscal year 2016, the Charles Koch Foundation donated $100,000 to Goldwater. The Mercer Family Foundation, backed by the billionaires that propelled Trump to power, donated $1.1 million between 2014 and 2016. Goldwater has also accepted more than $1 million from the murky right-wing fund Donors Trust, through which billionaires like the Kochs and Mercers funnel money to an array of causes.</p>\n<p>“The reason we’re interested in this is that these children are our fellow Americans who deserve the same constitutional rights as every other American,” Sandefur continued, proceeding to quote Martin Luther King’s “<a href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">Letter from a Birmingham Jail</a>.” Sandefur has a habit of co-opting the words of black historical figures to justify right-wing agendas. He is also the author of “Frederick Douglass: Self-Made Man,” a biography published by the Cato Institute that paints the abolitionist critic of white supremacy as a “radical individualist.”</p>\n<p>While Sandefur couches his claims in the language of civil rights, Goldwater and the other right-wing groups fighting ICWA have a track record of challenging policies meant to address systemic discrimination in the United States.</p>\n<p>The Project on Fair Representation, which has also received funding from Donors Trust, is directed by Edward Blum, the strategist behind Abigail Fisher’s case challenging affirmative action before the Supreme Court as well as Shelby v. Holder, which gutted the Voting Rights Act by eliminating rules that required federal oversight of districts with a history of voter discrimination. Another amicus filer, the Pacific Legal Foundation, is in the midst of a lawsuit challenging New York Mayor Bill De Blasio’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/nyregion/affirmative-action-lawsuit-nyc-high-schools.html">effort</a> to enroll more black and Latino students in the city’s most prestigious high schools.</p>\n<p>The adoption industry, meanwhile, has a clear financial stake in undermining ICWA. A <a href="https://www.politicalresearch.org/2014/02/23/the-adoption-crunch-the-christian-right-and-the-challenge-to-indian-sovereignty/">high demand</a> for adoptable children, driven in part by an Evangelical Christian <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/127311/trouble-christian-adoption-movement">movement</a> that frames adoption as a social cause, has coincided with increased restrictions from foreign countries and fewer U.S. children put up for adoption. The Academy of Adoption and Assisted Reproduction Attorneys, whose members are paid to represent adoptive parents in court, has filed amicus briefs in at least four separate legal cases attacking ICWA.</p>\n<div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div>\n<p>The relative material wealth of people living outside of Native communities is the subtext of the arguments for more adoptions to non-Native families.</p>\n<p>Chad Brackeen, an evangelical Christian whose property includes a pool, greenhouse, and zip line, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/health/navajo-children-custody-fight.html">reportedly</a> told the family court judge that he imagined the baby girl “not as an infant living in a room with a great-aunt but maybe as an adolescent in smaller, confined homes.” He added, “I’m a little bit concerned with the limited financial resources possibly to care for this child, should an emergency come up.”</p>\n<p>Sandefur dismissed statistics showing that Native children continue to be disproportionately removed from their families. “Do you assume that these kids shouldn’t have been removed?” he asked The Intercept. “Native Americans are also overrepresented in terms of the poverty statistics, crime statistics, and drug and alcohol statistics, so it’s natural to assume that children growing up in such circumstances are going to be taken into state custody more often.”</p>\n<p>It was Darcy Olsen, Goldwater’s former CEO, who initially set the organization’s sights on ICWA. Olsen has fostered and adopted multiple children, and since she left Goldwater, her vision has expanded far beyond Indian Country. Through her nonprofit Generation Justice, she is pushing for state-level laws that would limit kinship preferences in all adoptions and more quickly <a href="https://www.genjustice.org/news/m.blog/196/op-ed-america-s-flood-of-opioid-orphans">terminate</a> parental rights, particularly for parents coping with addiction.</p>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-255025" src="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/AP_783531221230-1560542386-1024x695.jpg" alt="Participants listen during a rally in support of three-year-old baby Veronica, Veronica\'s biological father, Dusten Brown, and the Indian Child Welfare Act, in Oklahoma City, Monday, Aug. 19, 2013.

If you look at the rhetoric being put out by some of ICWA’s most staunch opponents, it is eerily and frighteningly similar.”</p>\n<p>Smith said there’s plenty of room to build a system that better supports Native children. “If we’re really going to talk about child welfare, we need to talk about the welfare of moms,” she said, and assuring they have access to safe and affordable housing and health care — the kinds of services that could be undermined with the Texas ICWA decision as precedent.</p>\n<p>Adams is hopeful that it won’t get to that point. “This decision is only the first step in a long process,” Adams said. “Indian country will be fighting together to ensure that doesn’t happen.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/17/indian-child-welfare-act-goldwater-institute-legal-battle/">How a Right-Wing Attack on Protections for Native American Children Could Upend Indian Law</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://theintercept.com">The Intercept</a>.</p>\n',

For many low- and middle-income countries, however, <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/better-health-procurement">a new report</a> from the Center for Global Development that we co-authored shows that global markets for generic medicines are failing, leaving the poorest patients without safe and affordable essential medicines.</p>\n<p>The first point of failure is drug quality. In wealthy countries, residents can usually trust that all drugs on pharmacy shelves are safe, authentic, and potent. Most families and doctors are happy to opt for quality-assured generics that have been tested for bioequivalence, systematically monitored for adverse events, subject to regular inspection for manufacturing quality, and priced well below their branded competitors. As we describe in the report, in the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, non-branded generic drugs account for more than 80% of all pharmaceutical consumption by volume (and roughly 30% by value).</p><p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/17/failing-generic-drug-markets/?utm_campaign=rss">Read the rest&hellip;</a></p>',

      'content:encoded': '<p><u>Brazil’s Justice Minister</u> Sérgio Moro, while serving as a judge in a corruption case that upended Brazilian politics, took to private chats to mock the defense of former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and direct prosecutors’ media strategy, according to newly unearthed chats from an archive obtained by The Intercept Brasil.</p>\n<p>The new revelations, which were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/14/sergio-moro-enquanto-julgava-lula-sugeriu-a-lava-jato-emitir-uma-nota-oficial-contra-a-defesa-eles-acataram-e-pautaram-a-imprensa/">published in Portuguese by The Intercept Brasil on Friday</a>, have added fuel to a weeklong political firestorm in Brazil. The country&#8217;s largest circulation newspaper, Folha de São Paulo, said the reporting suggests that officials &#8220;<a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/conversas-sobre-odebrecht-sugerem-que-moro-e-deltan-ignoraram-limites-da-lei.shtml">ignored the limits of the law</a>,&#8221; while UOL, a news website, <a href="https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2019/06/15/sergio-moro-telegram-lista-politicos-delacao-odebrecht.htm">said</a> jurists view the revelations as &#8220;grave.&#8221; The site quoted the head of a national criminal law association saying, &#8220;This is unthinkable in any democracy. It&#8217;s scary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the newly revealed chats with a senior prosecutor — a member of the team working on the Operation Car Wash corruption case — Moro said, “Maybe, tomorrow, you should prepare a press release” to point out inconsistencies in Lula’s arguments, adding, “The defense already put on their little show.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\'stylized pull-right\'data-shortcode-type=\'pullquote\' data-pull=\'right\'>&#8220;You should prepare a press release explaining the contradictions between his testimony and the rest of the evidence or with his previous testimony. After all, the defense already put on their little show.&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>Moro’s advice was a major deviation from their previous communications strategy, but prosecutors did as he asked — further evidence of bias and unethical collaboration between the two parties in the case that sent Lula to prison on corruption charges, making the <a href="https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,desaprovacao-alta-atinge-maioria-dos-candidatos-ao-planalto-nas-eleicoes-2018,70002464138">most popular politician</a> in Brazil ineligible to run in the 2018 presidential election.</p>\n<p>The newly published chats come from an <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-archive-operation-car-wash/">archive of documents, provided to The Intercept Brasil by an anonymous source</a>, which includes years of private communications from the prosecutorial task force responsible for the Car Wash case, the largest anti-corruption investigation in Brazilian history.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, The Intercept published explosive group chats between Car Wash prosecutors and conversations between task force coordinator Deltan Dallagnol and Moro, showing that the then-judge and the prosecutors were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">unethically and inappropriately collaborating in secret</a>. Despite repeatedly insisting in public that they were acting ethically and impartially, the chats revealed that the judge was passing on advice, investigative leads, and inside information to the prosecutors — who were themselves <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/">plotting to prevent</a> Lula&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party from winning last year&#8217;s election.</p>\n<div class="promote-embed" data-promo="secret-brazil-archive" data-crop="promo"></div>\n<p>Lula, who had been the far and away favorite in election polls, was rendered ineligible by his conviction, and instead the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro handily won over Lula&#8217;s replacement. Lula has maintained that he was not granted a fair trial. Moro is now Bolsonaro&#8217;s justice minister.</p>\n<p>In an <a href="https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/leia-a-integra-da-entrevista-com-sergio-moro/">interview on Friday</a> with the Estado de São Paulo newspaper, Moro said, &#8220;The Brazilian legal tradition does not prevent personal contact and such conversations between judges, lawyers, detectives, and prosecutors.&#8221; This type of communication is &#8220;absolutely normal,&#8221; he added. However, the chats published by The Intercept Brasil show that the communication went far beyond &#8220;personal contact&#8221; and &#8220;conversations&#8221; to include directives as to how the prosecutors should operate inside and outside of the courtroom.</p>\n<p>The Car Wash task force refused to comment on the contents of this story. In a statement, Moro declined to speak to the substance of this article, but said, &#8220;The Minister of Justice and Public Security will not comment on alleged messages from public authorities collected through criminal invasion by hackers and that may have been tampered with and edited, especially without prior analysis by independent authorities that can certify their integrity. In the case in question, the alleged messages were not even sent previously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite repeatedly using the phrase &#8220;alleged messages,&#8221; Moro <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/06/foi-descuido-meu-diz-moro-sobre-mensagem-a-lava-jato-com-pistas-contra-lula.shtml">acknowledged the authenticity </a>of at least one of the conversations this past Friday. Questioned during a press conference about having <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-lula-operation-car-wash-sergio-moro/">passed on an investigative lead</a> to prosecutors on December 7, 2015, Moro said it was an &#8220;oversight on my part.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>&#8220;The Defense Already Put on Their Little Show&#8221;</h3>\n<div class=\'img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto\' style=\'width: auto;\'>\n<a href="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-516938650-1560641344.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-255114" src="https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/06/GettyImages-516938650-1560641344.jpg" alt="GettyImages-516938650" /></a></p>\n<p class="caption overlayed">Prosecutor Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima talks about the 26th stage of the Lava Jato operation, called Xepa, during a press conference at the Superintendency of the Federal Police in Curitiba, Brazil, on March 22, 2016.</p>\n<p class=\'caption source pullright\' style=\'\'>Photo: Heuler Andrey/AFP/Getty Images</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;What did you think?&#8221; It was 10:04 p.m. on May 10, 2017, and then-Judge Sérgio Moro was using the Telegram messaging app to talk with Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima, a senior prosecutor in the Operation Car Wash task force. Moro had just wrapped up one of the most important days of his career and was looking for feedback.</p>\n<p>In a modest courtroom in the city of Curitiba, Moro had deposed Lula for more than five hours, as thousands of the former president’s supporters protested outside. Later that day, video recordings of the unusual proceedings — unusual because former presidents are rarely tried on corruption charges and also because judges don&#8217;t usually interrogate the accused for hours on end — were released to the public. Less than a year later, Moro would sentence Lula to more than nine years in prison for receiving a beachfront triplex apartment as a bribe for facilitating contracts with the state-run oil company Petrobras. But, for the moment, the judge was concerned about how the public was receiving the news about his interrogation of Lula.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought it went really well,&#8221; Santos Lima, the prosecutor, responded. &#8220;He started antagonizing us, which gave me some peace of mind.

The Folha de São Paulo newspaper ran an <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/05/1883172-depoimento-de-lula-teve-diversas-contradicoes-dizem-procuradores.shtml">article</a> the next day with the headline, &#8220;Lula&#8217;s testimony had &#8216;several contradictions&#8217;, prosecutors say.&#8221; Exame magazine <a href="https://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/forca-tarefa-da-lava-jato-ve-contradicoes-em-depoimento-de-lula/">ran a piece</a> titled, &#8220;Car Wash task force sees contradictions in Lula&#8217;s testimony.&#8221; The Estado de São Paulo <a href="https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/procuradores-da-lava-jato-acusam-defesa-de-lula-de-informacao-falsa-a-sociedade/">ran with</a> &#8220;Prosecutors accuse Lula&#8217;s defense of lying in triplex case.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Santos Lima, the first prosecutor to receive Moro&#8217;s suggestion to speak out about the &#8220;contradictions&#8221; in Lula&#8217;s defense, <a href="https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/um-tanto-triste-diz-procurador-da-lava-jato-sobre-lula-responsabilizar-marisa/">did an interview</a> with Estado de São Paulo&#8217;s &#8220;Broadcast Político&#8221; podcast, in which he said he did &#8220;not see any consistency&#8221; in Lula&#8217;s claims and defended Moro in response to the former president&#8217;s criticisms.</p>\n<p>Later that night, 24 hours after Moro&#8217;s initial suggestion, Dallagnol messaged the judge to inform him that they had submitted a petition &#8220;more for strategy&#8221; that was &#8220;not essential&#8221; and that the judge &#8220;should feel free, it&#8217;s unnecessary to say, to deny&#8221; the request. He then went on to summarize their media strategy for the day.
