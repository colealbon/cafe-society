### WARNING !!!  
this project is under heavy development.  

cafe-society.news is a web based RSS reader with machine learning and manual filters. 

### vision:  
As a newspaper and more generally as a business, cafe-society endeavors to exploit externalities emerging from a peer-to-peer decentralized application infrastructure.  In short, we rely primarily on user supplied storage, networking, and CPU, and are working on the tools to externalize the cost of professional services.  We're starting with machine learning based news curators trained by our readers.  We'll provide tools to support incentives and take a reasonablen usage fee.  If you share this vision either directly or tangentially, we hope you introduce yourself.  Participate with us by using and contributing to the site or tell us how we can participate with you.  (hint: we need rent money)

### current features:  
- not working but used to work, sync your read items state between devices.  (requires free blockstack id)
- ability to add or delete unlimited news feeds
- ability to add or delete news categories (sections)
- thumbs up / thumbs down style machine learning per section
- keyword filters to block content you know to be annoying (example block articles containing the word )

### future features:
- option to publish your settings/machine learning work to classifieds section
- scriptless scripts/smart contract enabled marketplace allowing readers to share and monetize their sweat equity investment in machine learning training.


### problems:
- blockstack sync is spurious (which is worse than not working at all)  It is our immediate priority
